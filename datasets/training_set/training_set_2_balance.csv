ptsd,Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that.,1
ptsd,And then I just want it to go away.,1
ptsd,"I dont know what to do about this, I feel like the world doesn't want me to talk about it.",1
ptsd,It's to uncomfortable for people...,1
ptsd,But I hate these feelings and they are just the tip of the iceburg that is ptsd.,1
ptsd,I felt like I needed to say something somwhere though.,1
ptsd,He got flustered really easily or would get angry over something simple—traffic or a common life situation.,1
ptsd,"He seems to have no patience anymore, especially with me and will just shut down.",1
ptsd,It would take until my mid-twenties before I stopped letting people hurt me.,1
ptsd,I've been out of therapy for almost 10 years but my coping mechanisms have been failing.,1
ptsd,I'm having breakdown after breakdown after the slightest trigger and there are SO MANY triggers!,1
ptsd,"I saw a professional for a psych evaluation and though there are no flashbacks or nightmares, I still am placed with the ptsd label.",1
ptsd,"I know this isn’t something you just “get over” I just thought I moved on from my “trauma” I watched a few episodes of bojack horseman and it’s thrown me into an episode of depression Idk I’m sad, I’m mad, I get irritable I have no idea what symptoms and triggers are for me, I just keep going because if I don’t I’ll stop and fall apart.",1
ptsd,I would’ve rather been told I’m a sociopath/psychopath or a narcissist due to my severe apathy towards everything.,1
ptsd,"My siblings would cry whenever they didn’t get what they wanted, they were rather spoiled, and would tell on me if I didn’t do what they wanted.",1
ptsd,Mom would be in the middle of homework or class and she’d just wail on me for no reason.,1
ptsd,"I cannot move, even though I am fully aware I am standing in the door.",1
ptsd,Do I force myself to move forward?,1
ptsd,Am I being ridiculous because I still have ptsd?,1
ptsd,I feel like they’re so out of line.,1
ptsd,I’m all over the place.,1
ptsd,As a result I had a total burn out.,1
ptsd,My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people.,1
ptsd,It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all.,1
ptsd,It's not really safe for me to be driving.,1
ptsd,I can't even function enough to do the grocery shopping.,1
ptsd,"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often.",1
ptsd,My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).,1
ptsd,I am afraid of anything and everything at the same time I am afraid of what happened or what may happen.,1
ptsd,"I am afraid the world, the earth, the skies, the stars, aliens, humans, animals, whatever fucking bullshit thought that had occurred in my head that makes my skin crawl.",1
ptsd,I am afraid of what I am or what I might become.,1
ptsd,"I am afraid that I might go crazy or fight that I might become boring, or normal, or average, or weird, or some fucking hippie, or some fucking stupid hard-headed person.",1
ptsd,I'm finally at the place in my counselling where my therapist and I both think I'm ready to work through it.,1
ptsd,"Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger, and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore, and my body felt all weird and flat, my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule, my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it.",1
ptsd,Things got better in middle school (thankfully) but it’s sad how literally 5 years as a young child (when life was supposed to be good) were so rough and still affect my life to this day.,1
ptsd,My home life wasn’t super bad but school was a living hell.,1
ptsd,I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting.,1
ptsd,Bullying in elementary school directly caused so many of my mental health issues.,1
ptsd,"And I’ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can’t breathe I’m shaking I’m numb.",1
ptsd,I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive.,1
ptsd,My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day.,1
ptsd,My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents.,1
ptsd,I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it.,1
ptsd,"It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either.",1
ptsd,"), but my PTSD symptoms are loud.",1
ptsd,"I'm not sleeping, my self harm has escalated and I'm struggling to leave my house.",1
ptsd,I'm also just about to lose my job because the company I work for is going under.,1
ptsd,"but when it was happening, I felt only halfway there.",1
ptsd,"and now my memory of it is hazy, and when I try to think about it I don't see it from my perspective, I see it from like above me.",1
ptsd,like it wasn't *actually*happening to me.,1
ptsd,The past few nights I have been drifting off to sleep and then I get the sensation that I'm falling and jerk awake.,1
ptsd,"I've had it happen before to me, but never like 50 times in a row that prevents me from sleeping.",1
ptsd,Like fucking why?,1
ptsd,"But I do not even think the therapist is supposed to actually care, she actually seems to, but I cannot understand it.",1
ptsd,"I did not start therapy because I thought she would care, I started therapy because I jumped off a bridge 1 year ago and I have an 18 and 21 year old brother and sister who are too young to process a suicide, it would be wrong, so therapy is the thing I figured.",1
ptsd,"But another part of me feels tied down these days, I am getting tired of this town and want to pick up my pack and go on down that open road just as I have 16 times in these past 15 years and she is the only reason I don't.",1
ptsd,"It feels great, but I'm worried.",1
ptsd,I tried to kill myself one year and one month ago.,1
ptsd,I am prone to depression.,1
ptsd,"I am worried about crashing too hard, and I have kids to care for.",1
ptsd,I started to get depressed but was personally unaware.,1
ptsd,"My wife started to notice that I wasn't eating, was moody, not sleeping, and laying in bed all day.",1
ptsd,She asked me if I was ok and I... broke down.,1
ptsd,All emotions came to a tipping point and I started whaling in tears.,1
ptsd,I told her I had been thinking about suicide.,1
ptsd,I can't decide if it's healthy or not since most of the traumatic things that happened at home were in that space.,1
ptsd,"I'll find myself camped out, sobbing on the floor, but can't really pinpoint why it's the place I always seek out.",1
ptsd,"Secondly; if it's not helping me recover, how can I make the rest of my house more appealing?",1
ptsd,It sucks.,1
ptsd,I know I need help.,1
ptsd,I want to get help.,1
ptsd,"I was sexually abused throughout my childhood (at least 10 years, possibly longer).",1
ptsd,I forgot the memories for a long time but now I'm finally getting them back and it's freaking me out.,1
ptsd,My sleep patterns are erratic because I don't want to sleep anymore.,1
ptsd,Is it normal to have PTSD with nightmares EVERY time I sleep?,1
ptsd,My psychologist has started trying to slowly desensitize me by showing me pictures and videos of what disturbs me: this is currently making things worse.,1
ptsd,And my nightmares are a terrifying mix of intense body horror and trauma flashbacks.,1
ptsd,So I wake up even more tired and in pain which makes me miserable during the day.,1
ptsd,"So now I'm having my chronic pain flaring up, my other PTSD symptoms kicking my ass, my other mental illnesses acting up, and on top of that I'm too tired from the nightmares to do anything about it.",1
ptsd,I just can't fucking win.,1
ptsd,I'm so so tired.,1
ptsd,"Hi everybody, I'm a 22 year old male who has had extreme depression and anxiety issues since I was 12 years old.",1
ptsd,I was also a competitive swimmer growing up and these issues started flaring up when I was moved into an age group with a very strict and demanding groups.,1
ptsd,I had swam maybe one meet before getting placed into this group and was completely overwhelmed.,1
ptsd,And I’m scared all the time.,1
ptsd,"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories.",1
ptsd,And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating.,1
ptsd,I’m sorry.,1
ptsd,I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,1
ptsd,"my abuser is in my family, and i am in the process of healing but every family reunion/holiday i must see my abuser causing me to enter panic attacks, constant crying, and flashbacks, causing an uproar to what could make me so ""troubled"" I am afraid of coming out to my family in case of being removed for my family forever and damaging relationships.",1
ptsd,I have younger family members i am trying to protect so i feel alot of weight on my shoulders when i am having a bad PTSD episode around my abuser and my younger family members.,1
ptsd,Also there was an attempted rape on me when I was 21.,1
ptsd,I never realised how much an effect these events had on me.,1
ptsd,I grew up believing that everything bad that happened was my fault.,1
ptsd,"I have tried so hard to make something of my life after that hell, but now that everything feels like falling apart again I feel like I am breaking.",1
ptsd,"I feel like I'm not even allowed to feel like this, because I deserve this hard life.",1
ptsd,"I don’t have anything to ask atm or anything that anyone else need to know, but i cant go to someone when I’m not coping or in a state, I feel like it’s something I have to ride out on my own, that I can’t tell anyone about.",1
ptsd,"I hate going throw this on my own, not that my family don’t try to support me, I just don’t want to see mum cry again because I’m broken and she’s tryed every thing she can but nothing helps.",1
ptsd,"Iv had more 5 therapist and seen at least that again in one off meeting, but I can’t engage and have developed a vague phobia towards them, I used to hide in the house when I knew I had an appointment and only come out if I was promised I didn’t have to go.",1
ptsd,I can’t see my condition changing.,1
ptsd,I suffer from PTSD because I have been abused my entire life.,1
ptsd,I was physically abused by my teacher when I was 8 years old.,1
ptsd,"My mother physically, mentally and emotionally abused me, up until I left her house at 16.",1
ptsd,"It hurts, every day.",1
ptsd,"Not all the time, but usually when I'm upset or having a hard time.",1
ptsd,It'd be nice to know the pain isn't all in my head and maybe it's actually a physical consequence.,1
ptsd,It just hurts.,1
ptsd,I can't help but feel so guilty for doing so.,1
ptsd,I am just nervous and very scared.,1
ptsd,"But there is no certainty, and I am so scared I am going to fuck this up.",1
ptsd,But none of that seems meaningful in the dead of night when I cannot sleep and get so sad and ruminating.,1
ptsd,I just do not know what to do to improve it or fix it.,1
ptsd,"I grab my partner and told him “ we need to get out of here right fucking now!” We made hour way out of the building, as we were exiting the conditions increasingly got worse, just as we made the door the room flashover, my partner was already in the hallway I was still in the room.",1
ptsd,After that I started struggling with anxiety at work and home.,1
ptsd,On my days off I started to drink excessively.,1
ptsd,I'm currently almost 19 but suffered a lot of traumatic events within my immediate family between the ages of 10-15.,1
ptsd,"This was obviously accompanied by some unbearable anxiety, as well as very severe panic attacks.",1
ptsd,"I didn't tell anyone, not even my family.",1
ptsd,"They didn't know, they didnt know because they couldn't know.",1
ptsd,I can't stop feeling miserable.,1
ptsd,"It's not even because my ex is going crazy, because he's once again proven I don't get to control my own life.",1
ptsd,I can't let go of the prosecutor telling me I only hear what I want.,1
ptsd,"I don't even know what he was referring to, but it has to be true because I honestly don't remember agreeing to dismiss he case.",1
ptsd,"I'm guess I'm not doing as well as I thought, and I must be as crazy as I now feel.",1
ptsd,"I mentioned I was blocking the signs, she asked why and I said, well, I feel they are kind of negative... And then she told me ""They aren't negative, they are funny, and since you don't think so you should think on if you even want to work here"", walks away and proceeds to tell my boss it isn't working out with me........ all because I expressed that I felt the signs were negative.",1
ptsd,Self-esteem hit new lows and had already felt really humiliated about assault before and wanted to tell friends to stop feeling so bad about it and to be able to talk to someone on days when my PTSD got really bad.,1
ptsd,"But now I feel even more humiliated about it and feel like anyone that knows is going to see me as damaged, so theres a lot of shame.",1
ptsd,I'm also terrified to talk to anyone else about it.,1
ptsd,"However because I was so young (high school/college), people have disregarded the validity of my abuse- which results in me hiding it from the world.",1
ptsd,"That sucks, but it's not as bad as what it does to me.",1
ptsd,"On top of crippling anxiety about everyday life, I have a terrible fear of commitment that I didn't realize I had until I moved in with my current boyfriend.",1
ptsd,"And when I came out of this ""blackout"" I was really groggy and anxious.",1
ptsd,I’m struggling to figure out what’s wrong with me at the moment.,1
ptsd,"I’m slightly annoyed because before all of this she’s been taking me very seriously and helping with so much, and now I feel like she’s being demeaning?",1
ptsd,But I wish I could find a place where it isn't so dark.,1
ptsd,"I can't tell if i'm becoming worse, because I did EMDR on my bad drug experiences and feel great now.",1
ptsd,"The rest of what i'm dealing with is early childhood trauma, which was prolonged so i'm thinking EMDR is just bringing out these feelings and making my body become very unhappy since im reprogramming it to not constantly be hyper aware and anxious.",1
ptsd,Ive had a few hospital visits because after some sessions i turn into a hypochondriac because the physical responses are so odd.,1
ptsd,One session made the left side of my face numb.,1
ptsd,I need quiet and darkness to recover from a major trigger like that.,1
ptsd,"We had left the radio on in the bedroom and it was blaring so loudly, but I couldn't move I just needed to sit for a little bit.",1
ptsd,I can't go anywhere without and inhaler and I tested positive for asthma even though I've never had an issue before all this happened.,1
ptsd,I don't know what to do.,1
ptsd,I feel like I should go to get psychiatric help but now that I'm in college and only working part time I'm scared of not being able to pay the doctor bills.,1
ptsd,I don't know what to do.,1
ptsd,I’m really tired.,1
ptsd,I get triggered and I have to start all over again.,1
ptsd,It’s so hard to see the point in fighting all of this all the time.,1
ptsd,I still live with my abuser and sometimes I can make it.,1
ptsd,"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often.",1
ptsd,My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).,1
ptsd,I'm not getting any resources from the VA and I'm not getting better.,1
ptsd,"After about six months there, my therapist told me I was ""too depressed to help.""",1
ptsd,I can't remember what was in the marital home when I left.,1
ptsd,"I am still piecing together weird, incongruous chunks of time, flashbacks, disjointed memories, and trying to figure out what happened; it seems like my brain just can't access specific details when I'd like it to.",1
ptsd,"The problem here, other than everything, is that I don't feel like my attorney gets why I'm such a useless participant right now, and I could use some advice on explaining it.",1
ptsd,My depression/anxiety has been building over the past 3 months after a long remission period and due to current circumstances has nearly swung full steam over my everyday life.,1
ptsd,"I have the scars, medical records, injuries, memories, and nightmares.",1
ptsd,I know it's caused me to suffer from CPTSD.,1
ptsd,But has it caused me to lose my mind?,1
ptsd,I can't remember agreeing to dismiss.,1
ptsd,night sweats (bed stinks so bad and I have to wash the sheets daily and my bedroom is 68 degrees and I only sleep with sheets.),1
ptsd,night terrors (re-occuring dream: waking up with the feeling that I am supposed to tell someone something to prevent an awful occurrence from happening but unable to say the words.,1
ptsd,The words just won't come out) Wife scared to wake me up because I am fearfully jumpy and suffer from panic attacks upon awaking.,1
ptsd,I can't be having PTSD from something as mild as what happened even though I have pretty much all the symptoms.,1
ptsd,I feel I'm just lying to myself.,1
ptsd,I probably just want attention.,1
ptsd,"I feel like a huge fraud... How am I even supposed to ""heal"" when I'm probably making everything up, I'm probably not broken, I'm just going to get yelled at again at the new therapy place like my last one because I'll be mute every session (don't even know why, I tell myself ""because I'm not ready to talk about it"" but it's been over 5 years since the last case and all this crap is minor, so it's probably just being ashamed over doing all this crap for god-knows-why when barely anything happened to me...), because ""I'm not trying"".",1
ptsd,"I don't even know why I'm posting this, probably just begging for more attention, I've pushed the last true friend I had away a few days ago over my fears of therapy.",1
ptsd,"My memory goes, I panic, breakdown, rock back and forth, sit in closets.",1
ptsd,It sucks.,1
ptsd,But it's kind of relieving at the same time because while I'm broken I'm not choosing to be dramatic.,1
ptsd,I was sexually abused when I was a kid and I suspect that I have PTSD because of it.,1
ptsd,"I've never been diagnosed with PTSD, but I have been diagnosed with agoraphobia.",1
ptsd,I rarely leave my house.,1
ptsd,"I'm not really anxious about leaving my house and once I get somewhere, I'm usually fine.",1
ptsd,I just have a very strong feeling of not being able to leave my house.,1
ptsd,"On the off days where I don't remember them I still wake up feeling tired, wake up multiple times.",1
ptsd,I just feel like I cant sleep like normal.,1
ptsd,It's really hurting.,1
ptsd,I just don't want to hurt anyone but I know deep down that it's me that's hurt.,1
ptsd,I really don't know what's wrong with me lately.,1
ptsd,It seems like every day I'm having some kind of meltdown and I don't know how to get back to normal.,1
ptsd,"The other night I had a massive flashback, no idea what triggered it.",1
ptsd,And for about two weeks now I feel constantly on the verge of an anxiety attack.,1
ptsd,I was a severe addict that had 2 overdoses when I was younger and addiction/alcoholism runs on both sides of my family.,1
ptsd,I don't want to come out of on the other side and be this nervous and uncomfortable person who is unable to have relationships.,1
ptsd,"I have been thinking of seeing a therapist, I don't really have the time or extra money, plus I've been really hurt from small intimate AA groups.... Ugh.... Is there another side of this PTSD mental attrition?",1
ptsd,"I'm not ready to talk about what happened, but it was pretty recent so even the small things are triggering.",1
ptsd,"I'm getting help, but these things take time and I can't just quit the internet.",1
ptsd,But it seems like I'm also dealing with abandonment issues with my parents which has recently reemerged after coming out as transgender which they don't support.,1
ptsd,"Unfortunately, I have Lyme disease and live with them because I'm too sick to do anything and they won't support my transition.",1
ptsd,I get the feeling that if I was healthy and I transitioned I'd never speak to them.,1
ptsd,But I mean does it really matter?,1
ptsd,I didn't know that either but I still felt the same.,1
ptsd,Also that whole living situation and that man was horrible and stressful anyway (without it being a trigger for something else too).,1
ptsd,Why did I open my mouth I should’ve just said “I’m fine” ~ I don’t need help Or maybe I do,1
ptsd,I really don't want to talk about what happened.,1
ptsd,"But, I really want the nightmares to go away.",1
ptsd,"Sorry if this sounds weird, I am really really fucking tired...",1
ptsd,I have complex ptsd due to past romantic relationships and some other various traumas in my life.,1
ptsd,"(Also diagnosed bipolar, severe social/general anxiety, OCPD) Currently suffering symptoms that and messing with my healthy thought patterns and its tearing apart my current relationship.",1
ptsd,I am terribly upset because this is the first partner to really take me as I am (dark side and all) The paranoid feeling that things are going to end has made it almost inevitable.,1
ptsd,"But now, I can't.",1
ptsd,I have completely given up on getting the correct mental health treatment.,1
ptsd,Even after he finished the exam he did another sweep with his hand idk wtf he was checking because we were all done I’m almost positive he just wanted to fucking touch me because every chance he could he would.,1
ptsd,"I was so close to tears I know this isn’t like so bad, but to a girl with ptsd from assault it was the end of the world.",1
ptsd,I felt so gross and grimy having his nasty hands on me calling me beautiful.,1
ptsd,"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories.",1
ptsd,And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating.,1
ptsd,I’m sorry.,1
ptsd,I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,1
ptsd,I know my thoughts are disorganized right now and I’m finding it hard to organize them.,1
ptsd,"“Fuck it, I’ll just microwave those fuckers and then give myself the decency to have a painless death.” “Ok ok, deep breaths.",1
ptsd,That completely threw me.,1
ptsd,I don't know why I'm finding it so difficult to cope.,1
ptsd,I'm crying frequently for some reason and I don't know why.,1
ptsd,I haven't done the whole uncontrollable crying thing since my last episode which was all the way back in November 2016.,1
ptsd,"I know he's never going to be the same, but it's hard seeing him like this.",1
ptsd,My brother lashes out when things don't go his way to and just has a nasty attitude at times..,1
ptsd,My family was never like that growing up.,1
ptsd,"Until recent years, I rarely got hugs from parents or my brother and when we'd brush legs while sitting, it'd be an awkward ""oh sorry"" and a shuffle to separate.",1
ptsd,I feel so worthless on those days.,1
ptsd,"I had PTSD for almost a year before going on benzos, but it wasn't until I was put on benzos (and then stupidly chose to continue a do-it-yourself habit) that my mind just happily dissociated - I barely remember the last year.",1
ptsd,What in the fuck have I done to myself?,1
ptsd,My husband had several things happen to him when he was a teenager and occasionally when things get very bad for him he has very bad flashbacks complete with regression to the time when the trauma happened.,1
ptsd,"It is heartbreaking to see, and obviously he does not recognize me and does not understand why we live together and why he’s not living at his parents house Does anyone have experience with this kind of flashbacks?",1
ptsd,I am constantly afraid of when it's going to happen next and I'm so scared I'm going to have some embarrassing reaction to it.,1
ptsd,It happened today and I was able to play it cool for about 5 minutes and then I went on my lunch and cried my eyes out in my car.,1
ptsd,I've been having really bad flashbacks all afternoon and night.,1
ptsd,I really wish it didn't get to me like this.,1
ptsd,I've wanted to kill myself almost everyday for 17 years.,1
ptsd,I'm done talking to therapists and asking friends for help.,1
ptsd,Right now I see two options: commit suicide or develop an emergency self-care plan for when I'm feeling this way so I'll be okay until I feel safe again.,1
ptsd,I'm afraid that maybe they aren't true and I'm demonizing him in my memory because having a villain that did horrible things to me is just easier to digest than the complicated truth.,1
ptsd,"The worst thing is, I can't bring myself to talk to anybody.",1
ptsd,I always felt like I wasn't bad enough to need a doctor.,1
ptsd,I felt like I could get through it on my own.,1
ptsd,"Even now, its hard for me to open up to my fiance about these things.",1
ptsd,I'm not very good at expressing my emotions.,1
ptsd,I was molested multiple times by my biological dad when I was 5 up until middle school (so like 10 yrs old).,1
ptsd,"After many times in the past telling my mom that my dad had ""touched me weird"" my mom had gotten annoyed and mad at me.",1
ptsd,He denied it and ever since then I think everyone is out to get me and that nothing ever happened and I'm just insane.,1
ptsd,I always doubt myself and it's hard to hang out with anyone because I think they all have some agenda toward me.,1
ptsd,I know logically nothing happened but when I get home I have to always check my body for bruises or anything suspicious.,1
ptsd,Then I feel shameful and want to self harm/die when I realize I'm accusing someone innocent of something so terrible and then my mind tells me nothing ever happened and I'm just nuts.,1
ptsd,It doesn't help that my family doesn't understand me and minimalizes all of my problems.,1
ptsd,I came out of that appointment in tears.,1
ptsd,That was a horrible day and I still think about it.,1
ptsd,It made me feel like I had nothing to complain about.,1
ptsd,Its only taken me until the last couple of weeks to finally accept that I did nothing wrong.,1
ptsd,I don’t have kids nor do I want them.,1
ptsd,"I’m expected to be around them 24/7 and when they’re all losing their shit, all I want to do is crawl into a hole and hide away.",1
ptsd,"I’m constantly on edge because I’m constantly being startled or scared, there’s a lot of yelling and screaming and crying, and it’s only the end of day 3 of a two week vacation.",1
ptsd,"Sorry for the long post, I don’t have anyone to talk to about this until January when I see my therapist next.",1
ptsd,I am constantly freaking out and unable to see friends that don't know about my diagnosis or make the friends that do feel very uncomfortable.,1
ptsd,I feel guilty because I feel as if I brought this all on myself because if I hadn't of taunted my father he would not have attacked me.,1
ptsd,I know rationally this is not true but I cannot shake the feeling.,1
ptsd,The guilt is eating me up.,1
ptsd,"I was diagnosed with PTSD after I was assaulted when I was 18, but to be honest I've never really felt like I had it.",1
ptsd,I can usually push things down so deeply that I don't feel many repercussions of what I've been through aside from a lot of shame.,1
ptsd,"In the last 4 months though, someone who's been on and off harassing me since I was 17 has resurfaced.",1
ptsd,"He was sending me hundreds of texts and calling me saying things varying from ""you're going to marry me and we can have kids and live together forever"" to ""you're a whore and you're a disgusting person and I want to (insert threat) you"".",1
ptsd,Matches up with my ex-wife’s thoughts that I don’t sleep more than 30 min before coughing myself awake and throwing fists.,1
ptsd,"-I don't have any relief in my symptoms and am concerned that I've wasted an entire year of my life I'm concerned that I not leave this relationship too soon, but at the same time, I'm paying for this therapy, I have repeatedly brought up questions about goals in my sessions, and don't feel like this is the right fit...unless I need to open up more.",1
ptsd,"I asked one of the cops what was going on a few times before the words ""Child Pornography"" dropped out of his mouth like a fucking anvil in my gut.",1
ptsd,"I didn't say anything, I could not comprehend that it was really happening.",1
ptsd,I've been through some shit in my life but I've never experienced the level of total bewilderment and unreality that I did when I realized the FBIs Crimes Against Children unit was raiding me for kiddie porn.,1
ptsd,He said that I should have ptsd because the reason I was wrestling my dad for the gun is because Im a sick bastard who wanted to kill him and the rest of my family.,1
ptsd,I don't know why I made this post.,1
ptsd,I don't know if I even really got out what I wanted to say.,1

ptsd,I wish I wouldn't think about it.,1
ptsd,It's like I get some sick thrill out of the fear and anxiety like it's a horror movie or rollercoaster.,1

ptsd,My therapist told me I'm meant to be alive and hugged me and I don't even know why because how could I be meant to be alive if I have thoughts like this?,1

ptsd,i don''t know if this is a OCD thing?,1
ptsd,if i have a multitude of things on my mind or other milder worries i seem to be fine but when my brain is quiet and worry-less it seems i involuntary remind myself of the ''dissociative flashback'' which starts a cycle of psychological drowning and feelings of detachment as well as depressive feelings.,1

ptsd,But I also feel bad for me.,1
ptsd,"I'm not sure why he thinks I want to erode their relationship, this is another thing I'm still thinking about.",1

relationships,Tl;dr: my bf changed his preference in women and now I feel like a shitty clone,1
relationships,"I thanked my boyfriend, and then immediately blurted out ""how am I going to explain this to my mother?""",1
relationships,"Like I said, he's understanding, but I could see him kinda wince as he probably realized that the gifts brought me more anxiety than happiness.",1
relationships,"It's even starting to affect my self-esteem a bit, because usually if someone turns me down (no matter how reasonable the excuse) I just move on to someone else and spend less time with them, but it's a bit harder when that person is already your friend.",1
relationships,This is all relevant because I'm slowly realizing that **keeping my relationship from my mother isn't sustainable**.,1
relationships,"Eventually, the truth has to come out, because I cannot live like this.",1
relationships,Problem-- my mother would HATE my boyfriend.,1
relationships,"Being a narcisist, she can't stand when I give anyone more attention or devotion than her.",1
relationships,I've been spooked when I've woken up because it's actually felt like he left and it happened.. can someone shed some light on what this means?,1
relationships,Recently me and my boyfriend had been going through a tough stage and I've been carrying a huge amount of guilt and I've been feeling like I'm not a good person at all...,1
relationships,"While my friends and myself included, have high hopes that this will work out, I’m petrified because I am putting my feelings on the table.",1
relationships,I’m going to be so damn vulnerable.,1
relationships,I know my feelings for him are real and I owe it to myself to fight for a chance of a relationship with someone I feel so strongly for.,1
relationships,I'm just really scared in general of not living up to expectations my partner may have.,1
relationships,"The last thing I want them is to describe their boyfriend (me) as bland or boring, but I feel like that's how I'll make them feel, and it'll just lead to heartache.",1
relationships,"We were doing so good.” I’m feel as if I can’t be angry at any of his actions, and my words mean nothing,  and my threats are empty.",1
relationships,"He makes me feel so horrible about myself when I even show the slightest bit of distance from him, he treats me as if I owe him sex.",1
relationships,"Never forces me to but will bring it up constantly, about how we haven’t and it’s just “makes him feel so bad and self conscious about himself” I don’t know what to do I told him I wanted to move back home and he went in behind me and unpacked my bags as I packed them.",1
relationships,But what kills me I guess is the uncertainty.,1
relationships,And I really don't know what to do.,1
relationships,But I just feel like my trust is broken over and over and over again.,1
relationships,And I don't know what to do.,1
relationships,I was venting how pissed off she made me to one of my friends.,1
relationships,She's telling my family it's because my head is all messed up from my mental illness.,1
relationships,It's gotten back to me and is making me angry and making me feel victimized and weird about myself all over again.,1
relationships,"She has a history of being extremely over the top, and in our most recent argument she verbally abused me just for because I was upset that she broke my trust by telling my personal details to someone I didn't know.",1
relationships,"Because she can be incredibly toxic, I've considered just blocking her and essentially ""ghosting,"" but I also feel like that would be very rude and she'd at least deserve an explanation.",1
relationships,How do I break up with her without having her potentially flipping out at me?,1
relationships,It’s gotten to the point where I feel like Tom is completely controlling me in the effort to “protect” me.,1
relationships,He won’t let me go anywhere without him and when he is forced to leave me he calls me every half hour and panics and comes home if I don’t answer (I don’t purposefully not answer- occasionally I am napping or studying).,1
relationships,But I was feeling more and more lonely... like I couldn't trust or rely on her.,1
relationships,It was tearing me to pieces and I was always anxious.,1
relationships,"Finally, after a breakdown I had on christmas over my fears and the lack of help from my partner in healing from this, she broke up with me.",1
relationships,I've been devastated.,1
relationships,"Not the type of physical violence, but emotional tension and turmoil fueled by running into each other at social settings and by alcohol.",1
relationships,"With all of this garbage happening to me, I find it hard to keep my chin up and to not be negative.",1

relationships,"Because of this, my relationship with my family is horrible as well.",1
relationships,"I don't want to lose one of my few friends over this, but I have no idea how to change or if such a thing is even possible.",1
relationships,I got upset and called the dogs in and closed the door.,1
relationships,When he came in he avoided me at first and when I confronted him about lying and sneaking around he defended it by saying it's my fault that I'm not okay with it.,1
relationships,The fact that he would prioritizing getting high over comforting me really hurts my feelings.,1
relationships,I'm tired of feeling like a plant is more important then me.,1
relationships,"but all I can think of is that I learned no one can be trusted including myself, people are inconsistent and unstable, people don't know themselves, if love exists then it doesn't mean much, and even if you truly believe that someone else cares about you and wants you in their life to the point where you finally don't question it, they can cut you off and start treating you like you're worthless without a moment's notice.",1
relationships,"the more I process what happened the more I realize there is truly no hope for me finding the kind of relationship I hope for, and there is really nothing else worth living for besides that.",1
relationships,"But, for now, and until I'm on the proper road to recovery, I just feel no need to have sex and it worries me more than anything.",1
relationships,"This has been posing a major threat to my sexual identity, and I fear if I initiate tomorrow I'll just burst into tears in the middle of it all.",1
relationships,"I'm so, so scared.",1
relationships,"If I do break it off, it's going to crush her personally AND add the awkwardness of her telling her friends and family its off.",1

relationships,I am not even sure what to say.,1
relationships,"My girlfriend was really, really mad.",1
relationships,"Not at my family, they're just basing this off what they hear, but at my sister.",1
relationships,"And honestly, I am really mad too.",1
relationships,What the fuck could she be saying about me?,1
relationships,"Perhaps as a result I feel awful about wanting more from him, I feel like it's incredibly ungrateful of me because he does do so much good for me and is really good to me in so many ways.",1
relationships,I feel like shit for writing this post.,1
relationships,"Wondering if this is emotional abuse and if it is, what can I do about it?",1
relationships,"I do not share this with the people I work with because I do not want to ""complain"" nor do I think it is any of their business!",1
relationships,"Today, I asked to leave at lunch time, because I was in a lot of pain, I had terrible cramps, and actually bled through my pants!",1

relationships,I’m crying and yelling and he is yelling at me and shoving a broom in my face and I just tell him I’m taking all my stuff out of the bathroom so now it’s on the shelves that I just cleared off.,1
relationships,&nbsp; >I can’t live like this.I can’t be here anymore.,1

relationships,"I know I should've been more careful, been more prepared.",1
relationships,But I can't do this.,1
relationships,"My boyfriend has been begging me to keep the baby, and it makes me feel torn.",1
relationships,"It has been very hard for both of us, but I at least have the kids.",1
relationships,I often feel guilty for feeling sad or lonely because he doesn’t have anyone there.,1
relationships,The problem is that she won't accept the fact that I want to break up.,1
relationships,"I'm a pretty nice guy, and I feel bad for her because I know she struggles with making friends, and I feel like an ass if I just leave her.",1

relationships,"A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic, he loves me to death, he tells me how beautiful I am every day, he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight, he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me.",1
relationships,I feel like I was the only one taking it seriously and it's dying a slow death.,1
relationships,"She approached me and started to say something but I interrupted saying, “If this is about my phone, I am under no obligation to share with you anything that is spoken between me and a therapist, and I do not care that this is during work, I have an emergency number to call at any time when I feel like I have to, and I felt like this was important as I don’t want to go back to the psych ward.” She stopped and just said “oh, ok sorry.” I understand that this may be a negative on my performance at work, and I may not be entirely right, but I have cut myself at work (not during work but after shift and right outside at my car) and the way I was feeling I needed emergency counseling.",1
relationships,I was so upset the entire day.,1
relationships,But I don't know what to do with my family.,1

relationships,"I get where she's coming from, but only if there had been inappropriate conversation or actions on my or my ex wife's part.",1
relationships,I don't know really what to do at this point.,1
relationships,Sometimes I think I'm making this a bigger deal than it should be.,1
relationships,His refusal to admit to anything though has me worried this is part of ongoing deception/cheating.,1
relationships,When he completely denies knowing anything about it I just don't know what I can do with that.,1
relationships,It feels like my options are to get over it/give him the benefit of the infinitesimal doubt or leave him over the inferred deception.,1

relationships,My thoughts are scattered and I'm honestly scared.,1
relationships,I don't know what to do anymore.,1
relationships,She ends up saying no almost all of the time and I'm getting to where I don't even ask because I feel bad that she has to say no.,1
relationships,And this leads to me feeling lonely and unwanted.,1
relationships,The part of this that doesn't feel fair is that she can ask to do something with me at anytime and I basically drop everything to go do whatever she wants.,1
relationships,He's the only one that can get me to that point of anger where I start sweating and shaking.,1
relationships,"He's never ""hurt"" me in a major way before and all the things that annoy me are little things like ignoring me, not responding to me when I talk to his lack of eye-contact and him generally ignoring/disregarding my attempts of communication.",1

relationships,She claims he has mental issues and had threatened numerous times to commit suicide.,1

relationships,I feel so ashamed.,1
relationships,Was it my fault because something like this happened?,1
relationships,and now it's like he did a complete 180 and decided that I have to do exactly what he wants.,1
relationships,"I really don't think there's any cause for him to worry so much about me, and I'm terrified of standing up  to him because, frankly, he does stuff like take my phone away or monitor my spending, so I don't feel safe standing up to him.",1
relationships,"I'm just at this weird point with myself where I'm holding back this resentment and anger at him for not taking care of himself, even after I've explained to him how much it stresses me out and hurts me when he is not consistent with his self care and/or medication.",1
relationships,"Though things are as normal as they can be right now, I find myself getting angry when he asks me to promise to do specific things for him, like do my laundry (I'm a bit of a mess), because it just reminds me of how he wouldn't keep that promise yet he expects me to do things for him (even though they are rational requests I should take care of anyway).",1

domesticviolence,Every time I tell him to leave he threatens to harm my pets or take them and release them to the wild (I have ferrets.... they CANNOT survive in the wild where I live) or he goes into rants about how useless I am and how I couldn't survive without him and somehow he worms his way back in for fear he might be right.,1
domesticviolence,**REALLY** don't wanna involve police.,1
domesticviolence,What do I do?,1
domesticviolence,It just seems like no one cares or wants to care about the psychological repercussions any of this abuse has on people.,1
domesticviolence,"I see you and Jane are out tonight so as I sit here alone and dying inside knowing that the most important thing in my life is leaving me and I’ll never even see you again, doesn’t something inside you feel just a morsel of empathy and reciprocal love back for me and to me and want to give me some chance?",1

domesticviolence,she berates my family (yeah my family is screwed up!,1
domesticviolence,but show me a family that isn't) and will freak out the moment I critiscise hers.,1
domesticviolence,how is it possible that he can drive and use his fist to punch you?,1
domesticviolence,"I don't want a situation to come where she calls the police lying saying I hit her (anytime a domestic incident happens, it's automatically the guy's fault) She's called the police falsely on my dad twice, so I wouldn't put it passed her.",1

domesticviolence,What if I am at a friends party and a man whispers in my ear that he likes to stare at me so he can touch himself later....but he is dating my friend and he knows I don’t want to upset her??,1

domesticviolence,"I felt minor relief every day I didn't hear from him, or his friends.",1
domesticviolence,What do I do?,1
domesticviolence,I feel like I’m nothing but I burden and I just wanna disappear.,1
domesticviolence,I rebelled and did my own thing as a teenager because I was so hurt from what I had been through is it normal for her to hold it against me?,1
domesticviolence,She just sees me as the fuck up causing her annoyance.,1

domesticviolence,"I feel like if I can help her and choose not to, anything that happens to her becomes my fault.",1
domesticviolence,I refuse to let that happen.,1
domesticviolence,"He's never hit me or hit the dog, but he will often pull the leash too hard and go too far with discipline.",1
domesticviolence,I wish there was a way to at least give women and men the chance to know of what they are getting into ahead of time and then let them make the decision if they think the person is reformed or not before getting trapped in a potentially abusive relationship.,1
domesticviolence,It makes me sick that the pattern of abuse can continue without any transparency.,1
domesticviolence,He ended up at someone else's home and I want him back so badly.,1
domesticviolence,I have no way to go get him and I'm scared and alone and  I'm a Christian but I need someone to tell me it's going to be ok.,1
domesticviolence,But when she becomes abusive and manipulative it’s too much and she says she will change and she’s taking meds now and she booked a counselor but I don’t know if this is more manipulation and lies or if it’s real?,1
domesticviolence,I just don’t know.,1
domesticviolence,She’s had soooo many chances to do this but only after we have separated is she ever actually doing anything about it.,1
domesticviolence,"It honestly baffles me, which is why I wonder whether he's paying them off (he told me he'd done this while we were together, although that could've been a fear tactic).",1

domesticviolence,"This past week he's gotten really bad where he told her she couldn't use the house phone, her cell phone, the computer, the car, or even watch tv.",1
domesticviolence,I don’t know what to expect.,1

domesticviolence,I tried telling him I am trying to fix myself.,1
domesticviolence,She doesn't pay for my tuition yet constantly puts me down by calling me dumb.,1
domesticviolence,He shouldn't be able to do that to anyone else.,1
domesticviolence,I'm just so scared.,1
domesticviolence,"I wasn't perfect either and I'm scared people won't believe me, or he will twist it so he's the victim and I'm the bad guy, although I know what happened was wrong and I have evidence that he knows what he did was wrong.",1
domesticviolence,"Im scared this will ruin my life, but I also can't bear the thought of him doing that to anyone else.",1
domesticviolence,"Even as I’m cooking, he’s still screaming in my face, telling me that I’m done at my job and I need to quit now.",1
domesticviolence,"I yell back, something about him not having a job and he grips me up from behind with an arm around my throat, and I grab the knife I was using to cut chicken and tell him to get off of me.",1
domesticviolence,"I’ve honestly lost my patience because I feel she should do something about it, but she won’t.",1
domesticviolence,She’s afraid to leave because he says he’ll accuse her of abandoning the home.,1
domesticviolence,I think she truly believes that because I am an adult now that all the screw ups all the pain I have been through is my own fault.,1
domesticviolence,"I know I may pay a price, for speaking openly in our small community.",1
domesticviolence,"I’m in Florida, can’t find concrete laws that apartment companies will let me off lease because of abuse.",1
domesticviolence,"We have had some physical altercations, like him pushing me down, poking me hard in the chest, him ripping off his shirt and than hitting me with it.",1
domesticviolence,"He’s also broken a few pairs of glasses, a remote control, smashed the hell out of his iPhone, and threw a chair across the room almost hitting his dog.",1
domesticviolence,So he hasn't really hit me since we got back together but he's cruel in so many other ways.,1
domesticviolence,He tells me I'm ugly and a dumb b****h and tells me I can't do anything right.,1
domesticviolence,He constantly calls me a whore.,1
domesticviolence,He constantly threaten to take our son and I’ll never see him again.,1
domesticviolence,He cussed me out and told me he not to talk to him until 1pm.,1
domesticviolence,So now I'm here not knowing what to do.,1
domesticviolence,I don't want to call the cops because I don't want my mom to get in any trouble for her gambling habits.,1
domesticviolence,**tl;dr**: My mom cuts her boyfriend because he grabbed her by the throat and I don't know what to do.,1
domesticviolence,"We will get through this and I am determined, even it means going to a shelter, to get affordable housing, so i never end up in this situation again!",1

domesticviolence,I’m pissed.,1
domesticviolence,I’m angry.,1
domesticviolence,I recently got out of a 2+ year abusive relationship and am now going to court against him with domestic violence charges.,1
domesticviolence,I am terrified to see my abuser in court and I was wondering what I should expect.,1
domesticviolence,I'm scared that I'm making the wrong descion.,1
domesticviolence,I actually do have access to some money where I believe I could pay off at least some of what I owe but I honestly don’t even know where I can get a number for the debts that I owe.,1
domesticviolence,"1) I am worried I might actually be in legal trouble over this, 2) I am afraid of seeking help from someone who isn’t understanding of my situation and will just be totally horrified about what a mess it is and they will be mean to me.",1
domesticviolence,I am NOT looking for a handout I just need help being walked through the steps of what I need to do to resolve this.,1
domesticviolence,Then I started to notice how much of a temper he has.,1
domesticviolence,Yesterday I was going to spend Christmas eve with him and his family and I tried bringing up some major concerns about the way things were going and he flipped out and started screaming and throwing shit.,1
domesticviolence,Am I nuts?,1
domesticviolence,Why am I so surprised i've come out looking like i've just had 10 round with Tyson?,1
domesticviolence,He has anger issues and he seems like a good guy sometimes (even though i know he's a fucking monster) and i know he's had a bad childhood.,1
domesticviolence,It's even harder because if he does get arrested or something for it my best friend won't have anyone to support her/pay for her tuition or her meals even... her mom doesn't have the money to do that and i think that's why she still stays with them... just so she can support her daughter.,1

domesticviolence,"Although I love him a lot, I don't exactly want the reason that I move in because he's trying to save me.",1
domesticviolence,I’m having a difficult time coping with how my abusive husband is perceived by family and friends.,1
domesticviolence,I sit next to him absolutely blank and speechless.,1
domesticviolence,If you intervene he will stoop down to the lowest level cursing his sons out with the worst imaginable.,1
domesticviolence,Am I imagining this or blowing it out of proportion?,1
domesticviolence,"Turns out I get really numb as the only way to not get dragged into this emotional swamp, but is a hell for its own.",1
domesticviolence,"But I told him that I’m not over it and his response was kinda like “ I feel so guilty, it makes my life hard, I wish you could just forgive me.” So now I feel pressured to forgive him and it’s frustrating because he didn’t give a damn about my feelings when I was 9 and crying my eyes out because I just saw my dad push mom and hit her.",1
domesticviolence,And I can’t help but feel like that fueled my brothers heroin addiction that almost killed him and still could cause he recently relapsed.,1
domesticviolence,I’m just so angry and I don’t want to be.,1
domesticviolence,What the hell can i do?,1
domesticviolence,"I'd let her hate me if it meant getting her safe, but I have no idea what this could do to the kids.",1

domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
domesticviolence,I feel like an empty shell of a person with no strength to get out of this mess.,1
domesticviolence,"The worst situations were forcing me to make a statement I knew was untrue (in order to allow me to get ready for work); becoming sexually rough and chasing me into another room to force himself on me, and rages where I’ve felt threatened.",1
domesticviolence,So why do I still feel conflicted about leaving?,1
domesticviolence,I guess I need an extra push.,1
domesticviolence,With my ass still against the door I grab the overflowing laundry basket.,1
domesticviolence,Sit on the fucking thing.,1
domesticviolence,He keeps saying im crazy not respecting his space where i keep asking for things to be amicable over and over.,1
domesticviolence,he tells me its my fault that everytime hes done anything to me its because i started it.,1
domesticviolence,I honestly dont know if its true.,1
domesticviolence,Because i kept trying to tell him leave me alone.,1
domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
domesticviolence,It's coming up so quickly and I'm feeling a twinge of anxiety as it gets closer.,1
domesticviolence,I keep telling myself I did everything I possibly could and that I should do what feels right to me even if it means I may feel like I'm going backwards at times.,1
domesticviolence,I also have to make a decision on if I want a permanent restraining order or a non violent contact order.,1
domesticviolence,"Myself and my brothers are contemplating getting a restraining order of some kind, but given how my dad operates, I'm not sure that will actually protect us from any harm.",1
domesticviolence,He spent most of the night afterhysterically crying telling me he can't live with himself after this and how he would never put his hands on a woman but something in him just snapped but I don't know how to forgive him or let it go.,1
domesticviolence,I'm still so shocked by what happened I have managed to stop crying and calm down but I don't know how to move on from here.,1
domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
domesticviolence,"The police are no help as I'm usually tossed in the squad car and questioned like a fucking criminal because ""why would she lie?"".",1
domesticviolence,I can't keep the 2400 a month in child support up because I can't get a job (I usually make 3000 a month net) and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be homeless in a few days.,1
domesticviolence,All I want is to help my daughter and make sure she's safe and I've run out of ideas.,1
domesticviolence,"I continued fighting his hold and he kept saying my name in a gentle voice and telling me to calm down, saying that he loved me and didn't know why I was freaking out, and kept saying, ""you know you're not going to win.",1
domesticviolence,"As time went on I would here everyday how I was too skinny, I need to gain some weight.. it got to the point to where I would ask questions about why I wasn’t good enough and was depressed ... he would throw a speaker in a room along with me and put stuff in front of the door to where I couldn’t get out.",1
domesticviolence,I'm so tired of this.,1
domesticviolence,I hate that he saw that side of me.,1
domesticviolence,I don't want to look weak in front of him.,1

domesticviolence,"At one point, she had me on the floor, cornered on the steps, repeatedly slamming my head into the wall and shoving a loose key that fell off the keyring into my breast, still trying to get the rest of the car keys out of my hand.",1
domesticviolence,"I'm not saying I didn't retaliate, but I only went to far as to push her away, never hitting her intentionally but more as an act of defense.",1
domesticviolence,I asked him where he had been because i was starting to get worried.,1
domesticviolence,Next thing i knew he was behind me with his arm around my neck squeezing.,1
domesticviolence,He continued as he threw me on the couch and wrapped his legs around my stomach.,1
domesticviolence,"I was upset his friend brought him somewhere that he ran into a girl he loves, and even though it was just a second it really hurt me.",1
domesticviolence,He isn't fulfilling the courts orders that would get him a chance to petition for supervised visitation.,1
domesticviolence,It feels like he's completely just disappeared from being a father but I still feel like he's going to come back.,1
domesticviolence,"He ended up grabbing me by the neck with both hands and slamming my head against the wall in the hallway, he threw me the ground I hit the radiator and then he threw a bucket at me that had a toy and DOG SHIT in it (i genuinely don't think he knew there was dog shit in it, he just threw whatever was there...and our dog must have shit in it.)",1
domesticviolence,I got right up and ran up the stairs and told him to let me in to get my shit so I can go.,1
domesticviolence,He told me to leave and I started kicking the door and demanding he lets me into get my shit so I can go.,1
domesticviolence,He immediately started screaming at my friends to “get the fuck out” and aggressively pushing them out of the back door.,1
domesticviolence,He then grabbed me by my arm and shoved me out the door yelling “take her fucking ass with you.” My friends sat with me for a minute and asked if I wanted to leave with them.,1
domesticviolence,Nobody should ever have to put up with that and have to live in fear of someone who can fly off the handle like that.,1
domesticviolence,I'm just not sure what to do or how to approach this.,1
domesticviolence,I’ve received hundreds of harassing contacts from him and he’s even tried to extort my friendship back by threatening to expose sex tapes.,1
domesticviolence,I’ve had him flip friends on me and had to move twice in the past to years to hide my location from him.,1
domesticviolence,"I’m trying to tell myself it’s like being beat up on the street by a stranger - it’s only once, but it still happened and it’s traumatic.",1
domesticviolence,It was someone I loved and trusted and I can’t believe he could have done this.,1
domesticviolence,"When I pushed him back, telling him to quit, he kicked me down to the ground and heel kicked my back until I had a panic attack and collapsed unable to breathe...",1
domesticviolence,Why am I feeling like I miss him.. I’ve been okay for 7 damn days & then he texted my grandmother & asked me if I wanted him to mail me my stuff (a card) & now I’m starting to feel bad.,1
domesticviolence,Why is he seeming so decent now... Why do I feel so damn guilty.. why do I feel like I did something wrong.,1
domesticviolence,But I’ve been ignoring him.,1
domesticviolence,Why do I feel like I’m in the wrong.,1
domesticviolence,When I told my mom I was in such a bad mental space that I thought I was going to kill myself and didn’t feel safe to be alone she said I couldn’t come over.,1
domesticviolence,I feel scared and I don't know if this would escalate into something worse.,1

domesticviolence,I just want to not be so alone.,1
domesticviolence,"I can't be in an abusive relationship, but I find my brain trying to rationalize this.",1
domesticviolence,"he could not understand why i resented him, when in his mind, it was ME who was being 'abusive'.",1
domesticviolence,"because i couldnt fake being into sex with him, which made me a 'bad girlfriend', because i wasn't ecstatic about always having to take on every responsibility and basically take care of him as if he were a child.",1
domesticviolence,WELL FUCK YOU.,1
domesticviolence,When does this feeling of guilt go away?,1
domesticviolence,"He has made me eat until I literally threw up, then forced me to eat my vomit.",1
domesticviolence,He will point guns at me.,1
domesticviolence,"Also, I didn't want to make things worse for her by sticking up for her in public.",1
domesticviolence,This household is screwing with all of us.,1
domesticviolence,"I want to move out, but I have nowhere to go, no job, and no money.",1
domesticviolence,I don’t know how to make him leave because he says if I do that he will go and dispute all the charges I ever made on his debit card and say it was fraud and he will have me prosecuted.,1
domesticviolence,"He says he will do whatever he can to ruin my life and see that I lose my job and lose the respect of everyone in my life and have legal consequences go using his money (which again, he said I could but now he’s saying I’m lying).",1
domesticviolence,I feel like he literally dictates my life.,1
domesticviolence,I close the door and put my back against it.,1
domesticviolence,"He's slamming into the door, trying to break into it, yelling that I'm crazy and I'm making everything up.",1
domesticviolence,"I'm terrified and sobbing, yelling for help and for him to leave me alone.",1
domesticviolence,At this point I'm begging him to let me get my phone to call my dad to come get me.,1
domesticviolence,"He finally tells me that I can, and that he can't wait for me to be gone.",1
domesticviolence,"Is it that the nerves have cleared, minute by minute anxiety calmed, hopelessness resolved, and now I have to sit a grieve a person I made up in my head?",1
domesticviolence,I am broken but I am piecing myself together.,1
domesticviolence,Part of me wants to wait shit out until my green card gets here and then leave him.,1
domesticviolence,"No this isn't just some edgy teen, oh I hate my dad, I have every reason to hate him, for what he has done, and continues to purposely do to me and my family.",1
domesticviolence,"For nearly killing me, for scarring us all to the point I can't even meet a nice person, or have any friends, and not wonder whether they do or don't treat their family like a lump of sh**.",1
domesticviolence,Nobody should have to call the police because they don't feel safe within their own home.,1
domesticviolence,"I could stay up here alone, but he says he’ll be where ever we are.",1
domesticviolence,I feel trapped and I think it’s making me like I’m acting like a child these days.,1
domesticviolence,He drained my accounts and I’m financially dependent because I fear not paying bills and I have to feed my daughter and myself.,1
domesticviolence,I love the type of father he is but I hate the way he treats me.,1
domesticviolence,I have no one to open up to or go to if I even tried to leave him.,1
domesticviolence,I’m tired of him abusing me mentally and physically me.,1
domesticviolence,He has cheated on me several times and each time it knocks my self esteem Lower and lower.,1
domesticviolence,I received the silent treatment from him and him being drunk and telling me that i'm worthless and don't do anything for him.,1
domesticviolence,He backed me into a corner in the kitchen and kept hitting me.,1
domesticviolence,"When he starting choking me, I bit the holy hell out of his arm to get him off.",1
domesticviolence,"I was so confuse and in tears I didn't know what to do, but cry.",1
domesticviolence,How do we deal with this?,1
domesticviolence,I guess that also comes with ignoring me all night.,1
domesticviolence,"Not being able to let go of the fact that I let this go on for so long, and even the fact that in my heart I still care and want him.",1
domesticviolence,"I know he will never be real, open or honest about who he is or what he did.",1
domesticviolence,"I have to forgive myself for letting this take over my life, my heart, my emotions.",1
domesticviolence,"The worst/best part of this story is that I am still with this prick, trying to get away safely.",1
domesticviolence,"No Idea why I am here, guess I just need to vent.",1
domesticviolence,"I hate how I am and I wish I could die right now, but I don't have the drive to do it myself anymore.",1
domesticviolence,How do I leave him if I know that life without him has been and will be a worse circle of hell?,1
domesticviolence,"I really don't know what to do, I moved down south to be with her and so I have no friends or family here.",1

domesticviolence,I didnt know what to say or what I could do to help.,1
domesticviolence,"Sorry for the sad story, I just don't know what to do and it's painful to think what is happening to her right now.",1
domesticviolence,"I hope it bothers you oh so much, to know you hurt me all by touch.",1
domesticviolence,"Everything about you is so mean, I just wish you could get clean.",1
domesticviolence,He was going to choke the name out of me.,1
domesticviolence,I am his 24/7 caregiver i do not have time to cheat even if i wanted.,1
domesticviolence,He said i would die if i didnt tell him.,1
domesticviolence,"So i get on top of him and i say, don't you ever do that again.",1
domesticviolence,"Everytime, he gets mad he takes my phone or other items away from me and tells me he bought it so it's his.",1

domesticviolence,"I’m terrified of him, and praying that he gets the real help he needs at the same time.",1
domesticviolence,And I just don’t know how to sort that out.,1
domesticviolence,"I don’t know how to stop worrying and wondering what he’s doing, we have several court dates coming up so I think that adds to it.",1
domesticviolence,I’m just so exhausted and ready for this fight to be over.,1
domesticviolence,My friends and family don't understand why he is so jealous and controlling because they know when I'm in a relationship I'm faithful.,1
domesticviolence,"Im ready to take him out of my life, but what should I do?",1
domesticviolence,When hes angry I don't know what extent he would go to.,1
domesticviolence,How should I handle it?,1
domesticviolence,Ignore him or communicate calmly so he doesn't get mad?,1
domesticviolence,All of this has made me feel really horrible.,1
survivorsofabuse,Lately I have been feeling very angry.,1
survivorsofabuse,Angry that my abusive ex received no real consequences for his actions.,1
survivorsofabuse,But she says she can't stand hearing it because she's got enough on her plate as she actually suffers with depression herself.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Maybe I'm just over exaggerating thing, but i feel like I need to get it off my chest.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Through everything, I just froze and waited for it all to be over.",1
survivorsofabuse,"This sends me into an extreme anxiety spiral, because I'd been seeing his mother almost every weekend for nearly five years, and she does this at the drop of a hat.",1
survivorsofabuse,I don't believe it.,1
survivorsofabuse,I finally decided to say something a month ago because it was really beginning to bother me because I'd hoped she'd slowly overcome these fears with time but she seems to be content with how things were and not going to change.,1
survivorsofabuse,"For the perpetrators, for the abuse, for the dysfunction, for my depression, my suicidal ideation, my pathetic life.",1
survivorsofabuse,However I was still in the prison of depression and plagued by self-destructive tendencies.,1
survivorsofabuse,And I'm just really confused and don't know how to feel or what to believe or think.,1
survivorsofabuse,Did he kill himself because of me?,1
survivorsofabuse,"Is it my fault he is dead now, and that my little brother has no father anymore?",1
survivorsofabuse,I'm just so confused and overcome with emotions right now.,1
survivorsofabuse,I am so scared that he will realize how fucked up and terrible I am and not want to continue things.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I don't want him to go and he keeps assuring me he will not, but I am so, so scared that sometimes it is overwhelming.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I feel like this is a disgrace on my part, because, logically, I know that he very much likes me and he really wants to stick around.",1
survivorsofabuse,I am so fucked.,1
survivorsofabuse,I want to just apologize and make things right but some of the things the other person probably forgot or were just super insignificant.,1
survivorsofabuse,I want to own up to my actions but it's hard.,1
survivorsofabuse,I assume if people find out I was a jerk they'll all hate me and I'll be an outcast and a pariah :/,1
survivorsofabuse,"I was raped by an acquaintance less than 6 months ago, and everything is hitting me all at once.",1
survivorsofabuse,This makes very uncomfortable and I don’t like it at all.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ll laugh and tell her to stop and that I don’t like the feeling of it.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Being in there was hell, I cried most of the first few days.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I was very disoriented, couldn't sleep, the windows had metal grates over them.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Then I get this weird gut feeling and ask ""have you been drinking?""",1
survivorsofabuse,I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age.,1
survivorsofabuse,Should I seek counseling?,1
survivorsofabuse,But I’m afraid if I do I’m going to have to talk more about what happened and I’m going to break.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and can’t remember anything.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’m sorry if I’m rambling on it’s just a hard subject for me to talk about and I don’t know how to put into words the emotions I feel towards these events.,1
survivorsofabuse,I don't have anywhere else to turn to.,1
survivorsofabuse,I recently contacted my abuser.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I don't know why, I think it's part of my self destructive behavior.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I have a history of child sexual abuse, rape in a past relationship and problems with dissociation.",1
survivorsofabuse,"So I was feeling like a robot that day again, due to stress.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I told him I am dealing with that again, he knows about my problems.",1
survivorsofabuse,I had suicidal thoughts while working at the island.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I remember vividly when I told him that everything was my fault (in my child mind obviously meaning ""you make everything my fault"" which was very much the state of things in the house growing up) and he straight up told me to stop fucking up so much if I didn't want things to be my fault (I should emphasize all ""fuck ups"" were minor- letting a pack of strawberries go to waste, forgetting to call him as soon as I left school, etc- but punished severely).",1
survivorsofabuse,"Hell, even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I can't gauge conflict to save the life of me- even if I'm being an absolute ass, I'll feel like I'm the one who's being persecuted.",1
survivorsofabuse,"They try to hold my hands when we go out, and when I told my dad I needed her to stop being so touchy with me, he guilt tripped the fuck out of me.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I’m 19 in a few days, I need to get out of here, but I feel so fucking guilty.",1
survivorsofabuse,Idk Do I tell someone?,1
survivorsofabuse,Do I just quit?,1
survivorsofabuse,I got a very bad feeling but I at first ignored it.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I was scared because I didn't know this man and I didn't understand why her Mother thought it was alright for a man to babysit 2 girls, one of them being a child he never had contact with.",1
survivorsofabuse,It's so hard to just get through a week without thinking of him and now I can't stop picturing his stupid face.,1
survivorsofabuse,I want to crawl into a hole and just cry and scream.,1
survivorsofabuse,It sucks even more because I won't be able to see my therapist this week because of the 4th of July holiday.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm so shaken up over this.,1
survivorsofabuse,Even though we did break up I don't know if he's taking it seriously and if he just thinks I'll come home and we'll be ok.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm so tired of being treated like shit by everyone in my life.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I'm not strong enough to take care of myself, to fight back, to leave.",1
survivorsofabuse,"And I can't work, I can't even answer phone calls because of my anxiety, how am I supposed to survive?",1
survivorsofabuse,"My family doesn't understand my mental issues so I can't get help from them with it, they tell me I need to start looking for a job and I can't even say anything.",1
survivorsofabuse,Why did I have to scream in pain?,1
survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes the bashings would be so bad that I would call my mum while she was at work [sometimes my brother and I would be home alone after I returned from school, when he would torment and bash me].",1
survivorsofabuse,Mainly because I'm not financially able to leave and live on my own.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I do plan on leaving, but until I make enough money to do so I'm stuck here.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I want to share what has led to this point, because to be honest I feel like I'm pathetic, weak in incapable of accomplishing anything.",1
survivorsofabuse,Everything I do to move forwards seems to be halted and I feel like I'm being pushed back.,1
survivorsofabuse,"So, long story short my parents are terribly abusive, I'm almost 30 and it took me this long, with the help of my wife to realize this.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes I feel like I can forgive him for what happened, but sometimes I have nightmares and I feel dirty.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I went from hating and fearing my father (since the incident with my sister, which had ended up triggering the memory of being told that I was to blame for the marital issues, among other things) to the point I couldn't even be around him at family or friend gatherings without feeling anxious and wanting to flee, to being able to accept the things that happened in the past, and remind myself that they are in the past, and be able to interact with him again, even if I don't really feel any familial love for him anymore.",1
survivorsofabuse,"He claims he was trying to help comfort me, but I really am having trouble believing that.",1
survivorsofabuse,"But it hit close to home when my own parents have pressured me over the years to reconcile with my brother, angrily demanding how I'd handle their funerals, whether I'd insist on not going (I wouldn't.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Then I went home, drank an entire bottle of wine and cried while my husband comforted me).",1
survivorsofabuse,"I still liked it, but I was so stressed from the move and from the constant crying and fighting that my libido was down.",1
survivorsofabuse,It sucks because I work on a computer and type all day at work and do needlepoint and sewing as a hobby and I can't do those things when it's this bad.,1
survivorsofabuse,I feel so angry that I am still covering up for my abuser.,1
survivorsofabuse,I am angry I can't e joy my life without him showing up randomly.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I'm violently sobbing, so yes, of course I want to stop.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I feel really bad about myself when it happens, sometimes I cry and other times I just have rage.",1
survivorsofabuse,I don't feel like I can talk about it with anyone.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I could really use some advice on how to deal with these memories and emotions when they take over, or if any of you have found ways to stop memories from popping up?",1
survivorsofabuse,"In the first month I was living here, I was doing a lot of really self-destructive things and ended up hospitalising myself, but now I have a job and am working very heavy hours to keep myself busy, and am not drinking heavily or using drugs or self-harming.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Unfortunately, I'm also more or less repressing all my feelings, and I'm having trouble with mood swings (particularly anger), anxiety and more recently, daily migraines.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Remembering all these things has caused me some distress, even though I doubt if this event qualifies as abuse...",1
survivorsofabuse,"I told them nothing of the sexual abuse, only the physical and emotional, as well as his constant threats to ""break your arm in that goddamn door if you don't sit fucking still"" I was removed from my home in two days and placed in a foster home until my biological father could drive up and take me to what was supposed to be my real home.",1
survivorsofabuse,"What I feel right now, is mirroring how I felt then but honestly it might be worse.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I am alone, and I don't know what to do.",1
survivorsofabuse,"At this time I'm most interested in any 'quick tips' that can be offered on how to manage feelings of violation, betrayal, humiliation, distress, anger at the abuser and all those who stood by, ignoring the damage she was inflicting, anger at those who have protected her at the expense of her victims, anger at my family for their mistreatment, and how they effectively set me up for future abuse.",1
survivorsofabuse,"My mom noticed and she started screaming at him, and they start having a heated argument.",1
survivorsofabuse,It bothers me to see people defending pedophila and I often feel the need to respond.,1
survivorsofabuse,I think it seemed a safe way to vent anger at surrogates for my abusers and I think I wanted a chance to say what I never had the chance to say as an abused kid.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I have PTSD from being raped and abused, and I get uncomfortable when guys yell in the vicinity of me, when they yell at me, it’s debilitating.",1
survivorsofabuse,I don’t remember a lot of it I just remember little snip bits of what happened.,1
survivorsofabuse,I still have problems trying to remember what happened and I feel like if I remember it all I’m going to have a breakdown.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age.,1
survivorsofabuse,It would seem getting this out there would be a huge turn off for her (it certainly is for me) so why is she acting that way?,1
survivorsofabuse,"Again, I don't tell her this but it's almost as if she's trying to account for infidelity, except she wasn't...she was abused.",1
survivorsofabuse,I'm just trying to solve this in my head.,1
survivorsofabuse,My emotions are a wreck.,1
survivorsofabuse,"It does not help that my mom leans on me and only me emotionally, when it comes to my father who I don't have a relationship with and all their financial issues etc...I am dealing with a lot personally, and then on the outside there family stuff on top of me too, and I feel trapped honestly.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I did go to a counselor about 12 times after the abusive relationship ended, I still felt vulnerable and scared leaving it that place and told her I don't feel ready to stop this.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Now I am at the point where I feel like there is nothing nobody can do for me, I feel emotionally trapped and I don't know what to do, or where to go anymore.",1
survivorsofabuse,I spent all of that time trying to get to this point by myself just so some selfish POS could slap me down again.,1
survivorsofabuse,I hate this.,1
survivorsofabuse,I asked him to stop but he just yells at me.,1
survivorsofabuse,I wish he would die or never talk to me.,1
survivorsofabuse,He also forces me to take medication because I got mad at him because of this.,1
survivorsofabuse,He will just scream at me and threaten to call the police to throw me on the street or something.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm so scared I actually don't want to lose him.,1
survivorsofabuse,tl;dr: I've gotten gaslighted in my past relationships and it's caused me to have a lot of self doubt about my thoughts and feelings and question myself constantly.,1
survivorsofabuse,in this case I'm questioning if im actually losing feelings since I'm developing crushes on others.,1
survivorsofabuse,Basically I’m going through quite a bit right now.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I suffer from anxiety, depression probably (low mood, irritation, poor concentration) and things just haven’t been going that well.",1
survivorsofabuse,I need to start setting some healthy boundaries and cut these people out of my life.,1
survivorsofabuse,Do I tell my father or just fade slowly into the abyss and never look back?,1
survivorsofabuse,"I think about it very often, wondering if I should just do it, get it over with, but something keeps holding me back.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I wonder if this was my fault, that I would be turned away for not bringing it to their attention earlier, if I would be accused of participating, I keep wondering if they’ll believe an 18 year old or a 40 year old.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I wish every day that I had quit that job sooner, that the second people warned me that I had had the nerve just to tell another manager how he was acting, that I had told anyone how uncomfortable and scared I was.",1
survivorsofabuse,I had no energy and I cried and I thought about suicide all day.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm afraid things will never change for me.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm not strong enough to change things for myself and I have no help.,1
survivorsofabuse,What can I do?,1
survivorsofabuse,But i think the worst part is her emotional abuse.,1
survivorsofabuse,Like having fun to make me scared or cry and also always putting me down like i am not good enough or ignoring me.,1
survivorsofabuse,Also i feel like she is sexually attracted to me (i am 17 now) and uses some shitty pretending to touch me between my legs or butt.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I once tried to talk with my dad about it, but he said that he and mom have enough to do and i should pull myself together.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I feel like i really have to seek help, but i am so scared that people wont take me serious and think i am exaggerating.",1
survivorsofabuse,I feel like you aren't putting in the effort with me and I feel sick and uncomfortable doing this.',1
survivorsofabuse,"I said this in a variety of forms as well as having panic attacks - not anxiety attacks, full-on violent shivering, mute shut-down, crying, overstimulated, feeling like you're about to die panic attacks - most of the times when we were intimate.",1
survivorsofabuse,"To me is heartbreaking to know that the most I can achieve is to keep defending myself, but not getting to be loved, accepted and cared.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Telling me I wasn't pretty enough, my boobs weren't large enough, I wasn't thin enough, I wasn't a good girlfriend to him, I wasn't making him happy.",1
survivorsofabuse,I felt so unsure of myself.,1
survivorsofabuse,He knows I can't work because of my anxiety problems and he knows I rely on him.,1

survivorsofabuse,I'm looking for some encouragement to get through a phase where I currently just want everything to be over.,1
survivorsofabuse,Im so tired of thinking about things over and over.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Was it sexual abuse or wasn't it, should I move out or shouldn't I.",1
survivorsofabuse,All while I have less and less brain space to devote to schoolwork.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I've been suffering a lot recently, and I am on medication and undergoing therapy, but these bouts are cyclic, I always end up back in this position after a while, perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now, but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years), I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest, the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting, I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.",1
survivorsofabuse,"To other people it’s nothing, however to me, I can’t stand the thought of her being assaulted or harassed in that way.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Except all I want to do is protect her, part of me knows that she’s going to be okay, but I need some advice about how I should address the issue if this guy doesn’t stop, keep in mind the fact that I can wrestle and basically fight, and can someone tell me something that will help me hold onto the hope?",1
survivorsofabuse,I have suffered for years through an abusive relationship with my husband.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Drunk driving, attempting to detain me in one place so he could continue to yell at me, child endangerment, stalking, physical and sexual abuse, cheated on me multiple times, (including one instance I am sure was actually rape).",1
survivorsofabuse,I kicked him out months ago and filed for divorce as soon as I was able after that.,1
survivorsofabuse,"It's all the little things they do to invalidate my feelings, treating more like a live-in servant than a family member, and the occasional outbursts if they get angry/upset that trigger me badly...",1
survivorsofabuse,"It's making me lose ground, lose progress, and I'm having more and more trouble coping with everyday life...  And I'm afraid I'm going to just, break.",1
survivorsofabuse,"And I know this sounds so horrible and I hate myself for it, but I almost feel like it will never happen.",1
survivorsofabuse,And I feel awful for feeling that way but I've been trying (and patiently waiting) for nearly a year now.,1
survivorsofabuse,I just don't know.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ve started having nightmares again.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD (finally) and am working very little to try to get through this all.,1
survivorsofabuse,"After many times in the past telling my mom that my dad had ""touched me weird"" my mom had gotten annoyed and mad at me.",1

survivorsofabuse,I cried and begged him to stop.,1
survivorsofabuse,"The therapist says it is self punishment, that I want these people to tell me what a piece of shit I am to verify what I already believe.",1
survivorsofabuse,"The verbal, emotions, and physical abuse continued I also believe in my heart that he cheated He left Facebook up on his computer with a conversation he had had with another ex about how much fun it was spending time with her(a day he had told me he was working late, couldn't even come up with an original lie)...it shattered me more, I didn't know my heart could break into any smaller pieces When she was three months old I told myself enough was enough...",1
survivorsofabuse,He was yelling at me about how it was an accident he just forgot and all I do is bitch.,1
survivorsofabuse,When we got to the store we didn't even go in because he said I ruined his mood or whatever and we just went home.,1

survivorsofabuse,I feel like I cannot trust anyone.,1
survivorsofabuse,"After the suicide attempt, which over nine years, head been preceded by the traumatic end of a highly dysfunctional five year relationship, followed by a severe four year alcohol problem.",1
survivorsofabuse,Leaving my dad.,1
survivorsofabuse,So since my mom left you are probably thinking that the abuse stopped there huh?,1
survivorsofabuse,I found out that my behaviors are probably caused by suppressing my memories and not finding proper closure from the incident because it’s as if I’m still taking the blame for an abuse that was done to me.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Knowing how terrible of a person he is that some people have even told me he is a narcissist or sociopath, I don't know why I still think I should have just stayed, why I should have just seen if he could change despite how he never tried to change throughout our years together.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I just want to stop myself from thinking this way and fully move on and have myself realize I am so much better off, and I even try to remind myself of all the bad things he has done but it seems that lingering thought of, ""Well, was it ever that bad?""",1
survivorsofabuse,"Three months of this and talking with the one friend whom I could call for free between 9pm and 6AM due to AT&T's GoPhone policies whenever I could get away with it, or texting on a Nokia Tracphone (the ancient indestructible brick phone), and my sister lashing out at me about being ungrateful that they allowed me to come over and use the internet, triggered by my snapping back due to, something, I can't remember, and I just, stopped asking.",1
survivorsofabuse,"The same negativity, the same feelings of selfhatred, of self-disgust, of ***believing*** everything my father had dumped on me slowly took over.",1
survivorsofabuse,"We had some verbal exchange in the hallway and he slapped me so hard I couldn't feel the tear roll down my cheek my face was so numb, he pinned me to the floor one day and savagely beat me for at least 7 minutes straight for what reason i forget, after he was done beating me up he would punch in the back of the head repeatedly, this gave me headaches and i saw flashes with each blow.",1
survivorsofabuse,"For the longest I didn't know this was abuse, nor did I know I had developed all of these poor coping mechanisms to deal with being abused.",1
survivorsofabuse,I wonder about that night.,1
survivorsofabuse,But I don't know if I would feel this way about my options if I wasn't anxious and wounded.,1
survivorsofabuse,I wonder sometimes how I am going to feel when I hit middle age.,1
survivorsofabuse,Am I going to feel like I do now?,1
survivorsofabuse,I feel like I'm having a relationship with my phone sometimes and it's like a female Wilson sometimes lol (movie Castaway reference for those who don't know).,1
survivorsofabuse,"and ""how could you let me do this?""",1
survivorsofabuse,I've also felt extremely lonely and I've been craving touch more than I did before I was with him.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Watching movies, playing games, hanging out with friends etc all distract me for a while but when I stop all the bad feelings just come at once.",1

survivorsofabuse,I'm a wreck.,1
survivorsofabuse,I thought I've overcome this all but I'm just feeling alone again.,1
survivorsofabuse,After trauma i started isolating myself and attaching to creative work to get a sense of worth.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Hi everyone, this is my story, what I've been able to take away from it, and the feelings and the hurt that have lingered, as well as questions.",1

survivorsofabuse,I'm kind of freaking out right now because I think something happened to me as a child.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I don't even know, I'm sorry I wish I had something concrete to say but I don't think I could even type it out.",1
survivorsofabuse,I would normally talk to my boyfriend but he's not awake and I don't even know what I'd say to him - I don't even feel like I can say anything out loud even if I was with him.,1
survivorsofabuse,So I let myself get sucked in and...,1
survivorsofabuse,The incident that occured was that I threw a fit - my arms and legs thrashing in all directions.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I had no idea what was happening, I came out of it terrified and there was one guy left in the room.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I remember thinking, he felt ""off"".",1
survivorsofabuse,"Since then I have heard from him once, in the form of a drunken voicemail pleading with me to forgive him and swearing that he doesn't remember anything.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I'm trying really hard not to victim blame and immediately feel guilt when I think that way but, again, knowing my wife how I know her - as someone that's not afraid to call BS- it just makes it hard to conceive how she went along with it for so long, knowing that it made her uncomfortable, knowing that it was escalating, and then it was actual happening and her not saying no.",1
survivorsofabuse,I just can't believe these things happened on repeated occasions.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I can absolutely see him pressuring her once, her not knowing how to respond when it happened, and then her saying ""This is BS, I'm out"" afterwards.",1
survivorsofabuse,"It wasn't an issue, nobody needed to know, now I don't even know *what* people apparently ""know"" and are arguing about.",1
survivorsofabuse,Somewhere under all the anger about my mum making an issue out of nothing there's something that makes me wonder if it *is* a big deal.,1
survivorsofabuse,Maybe I'm just pretending I don't care?,1
survivorsofabuse,Maybe none of this even happened?,1
survivorsofabuse,I just don't know anymore.,1
survivorsofabuse,My boyfriend didn't care.,1
survivorsofabuse,I started to get psychotic at 17.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I  was so scared, paranoid, had delusions and hallucinations.",1
survivorsofabuse,And no-one to help me.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I just couldn't cope, the abuse I already remembered was bad enough but this...this was just too much for me to deal with.",1
survivorsofabuse,"2 weeks ago I couldn't take it anymore and took a large overdose, which ended up with me being in hospital...I now have done a little damage to my heart and shall have to live with that...I should probably point out that I am under 7st and have had an eating disorder since I was 7...it was the only thing I could control...you see I had no safe place, I'd leave my abusive home and go to school...where I was the only ginger child...sure I don't need to point out how hard that was.",1
survivorsofabuse,"This is going to stop quite abruptly now, for I don't really know what else to say right now.. Each and everyday is a constant struggle and I am tired of drs telling me to be strong and just get on with life...I am 26years old for 20years I have had to be strong and ""survive"" well I'm tired of surviving...that doesn't mean I want to die but I do want it all to stop, I want to <url> to be happy and trust people, to realise what love is, I mean I have an amazing partner who loves me dearly but I question him every damn day...you see he doesn't hurt me and love...well as my Dad taught me...love is to hurt and lie....but that isn't love at all is it?",1
survivorsofabuse,It was all so wrong of me.,1
survivorsofabuse,I couldn't sleep.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ve been trying not to get triggered or stamping on the instincts to just leave the place and be silent.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Even with that, I couldn’t even really keep a hold and have had hard days where I just wanted to stay isolated from the world and disappear in my mind and try to heal myself and it isn’t working.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I struggle to sleep sometimes and I do struggle with self worth, being comfortable with myself because I just don’t see myself as someone who’s important to other ppl.",1
survivorsofabuse,I'm really unsure how to deal with it.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Also, I'm not sure if I should tell anyone because that couldn't have happened right and it could not have been that bad?",1
survivorsofabuse,I feel like these experiences have totally altered my psyche and now i find gratification through exploitation.,1
