153,ptsd,I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night.,1
154,ptsd,Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.,1

166,ptsd,At night I hear the sound and burst into tears and calm down until I hear it again and start crying.,1
167,ptsd,I didn’t know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but I’m beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it.,1

169,ptsd,I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?,1

172,ptsd,They discharged me.,1
173,ptsd,I never thought I’d be in a situation like that in my life and the screaming and blood and chaos following it is just on a constant repeat in my head that won’t stop.,1
174,ptsd,I had to give 4 separate statements to the police which burned it from start to finish in my brain and it doesn’t stop.,1
175,ptsd,I don’t know if that’s just because it was less than 24 hours ago and I’m still just in shock?,1

184,ptsd,"In some ways, I can handle it more than the average person who hasn't gone though such a trauma.",1

186,ptsd,I'm tired of people misunderstanding.,1
187,ptsd,I'm tired of feeling weak and broken.,1
188,ptsd,I'm just tired.,1

191,ptsd,"I had a panic attack where I felt terrified and unable to move at my psych's this past Tuesday, but that's not typical for me, at least not anymore?",1
192,ptsd,"I realized most my recent ""panic attacks"" may be ""breakdowns"" because it's not accompanied by a sense of fear, but pent up emotions I haven't been able to release resulting in a sudden loss of control...",1
193,ptsd,"I start hyperventilating, screaming, and unleash all this pent up fury to the point where I feel detached from my emotions/self and have no control, start throwing things or hurting myself, until I'm exhausted and suddenly shut down/dissociate.",1
194,ptsd,"For me, that doesn't HELP AT ALL.",1
195,ptsd,"It just makes me feel like I'm just pissing him off, and my problem has suddenly become his, minimizing my emotions about it?",1
196,ptsd,"He always says I need to be protected, but he doesn't understand that it's not an imminent threat in my life anymore, but a constant struggle and disability; that my brain works and processes things differently now and always will.",1
197,ptsd,I just feel so very alone when I talk to him.,1
198,ptsd,"but if so many people are here for me, and things are going to be okay, why am i still afraid of them?",1
199,ptsd,why do i still have a pit in my stomach and why are these thoughts still clawing at the sides of my skull?,1
200,ptsd,why am i crying right now?,1
201,ptsd,"i don't understand it, i don't understand my own brain and i feel like an ungrateful prick for still being shaken up so badly.",1
202,ptsd,"My problem is, if I'm going to date anyone, they have to be aware that I struggle with PTSD and willing to at least be there for me when I need.",1
203,ptsd,"I don't need coddling or protecting, I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out, or help me through a flashback.",1
204,ptsd,"Everytime I have had a breakdown, and try to express things from the past, he audibly growls and talks about how pissed he is that it happened.",1
205,ptsd,"But her response instead was the title ""I am not getting into this with you"".",1
206,ptsd,I wound up in partial hospitalization and diagnosed with PTSD related to several traumas including sexual assault I experienced as a child.,1
207,ptsd,"This will be a good thing in the end, but right now I feel like I'm going to throw up.",1
208,ptsd,I recently went through an event that was extremely traumatic.,1
209,ptsd,It's been less than a week and not even sure what I'm dealing with here but all I know is that I feel like I am being discouraged from getting help.,1
210,ptsd,"It’s becoming cyclical for me, where I “retreat” and revise and then feel like I need to retrigger myself to avoid slipping back into denial that it happened the way it happened.",1
211,ptsd,I can’t live like this.,1
212,ptsd,I don’t want to live a lie but sometimes the lie is what keeps me functioning.,1
213,ptsd,My therapist is away for a month and this means I have no one to push me to deal with this thing.,1
214,ptsd,I don’t know what to do.,1
215,ptsd,It’s really kind of ruining my ability to empathize with some people Bc of comments they’ve made in the past.,1
216,ptsd,I witnessed the attempted suicide of my sister and then subsequent self harm targeting just towards myself for the purpose of manipulation and dealt with no one believing that it happened.,1
217,ptsd,"So many people have told me be happy it was a failed attempt, failing to recognize the damage knowing someone I love could want to hurt me so badly did.",1
218,ptsd,Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that.,1
219,ptsd,And then I just want it to go away.,1
220,ptsd,"I dont know what to do about this, I feel like the world doesn't want me to talk about it.",1
221,ptsd,It's to uncomfortable for people...,1
222,ptsd,But I hate these feelings and they are just the tip of the iceburg that is ptsd.,1
223,ptsd,I felt like I needed to say something somwhere though.,1
224,ptsd,He got flustered really easily or would get angry over something simple—traffic or a common life situation.,1
225,ptsd,"He seems to have no patience anymore, especially with me and will just shut down.",1

227,ptsd,But the trauma remains.,1
228,ptsd,I've been out of therapy for almost 10 years but my coping mechanisms have been failing.,1
229,ptsd,I'm having breakdown after breakdown after the slightest trigger and there are SO MANY triggers!,1
230,ptsd,"I saw a professional for a psych evaluation and though there are no flashbacks or nightmares, I still am placed with the ptsd label.",1
231,ptsd,"I know this isn’t something you just “get over” I just thought I moved on from my “trauma” I watched a few episodes of bojack horseman and it’s thrown me into an episode of depression Idk I’m sad, I’m mad, I get irritable I have no idea what symptoms and triggers are for me, I just keep going because if I don’t I’ll stop and fall apart.",1
232,ptsd,I would’ve rather been told I’m a sociopath/psychopath or a narcissist due to my severe apathy towards everything.,1
233,ptsd,Update: I should probably add that I was terrified of my mom and never tried to provoke her.,1
234,ptsd,"My siblings would cry whenever they didn’t get what they wanted, they were rather spoiled, and would tell on me if I didn’t do what they wanted.",1
235,ptsd,Mom would be in the middle of homework or class and she’d just wail on me for no reason.,1

237,ptsd,"I cannot move, even though I am fully aware I am standing in the door.",1
238,ptsd,Do I force myself to move forward?,1
239,ptsd,Am I being ridiculous because I still have ptsd?,1
240,ptsd,I feel like they’re so out of line.,1
241,ptsd,I’m all over the place.,1
242,ptsd,As a result I had a total burn out.,1
243,ptsd,Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again.,1
244,ptsd,My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people.,1
245,ptsd,It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all.,1
246,ptsd,"Alcohol helps, but then it comes back worse the next day.",1
247,ptsd,"In the months that it's not happening, I'm well-adjusted.",1
248,ptsd,It's not really safe for me to be driving.,1
249,ptsd,I can't even function enough to do the grocery shopping.,1
250,ptsd,"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often.",1
251,ptsd,My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).,1
252,ptsd,I am afraid of anything and everything at the same time I am afraid of what happened or what may happen.,1
253,ptsd,"I am afraid the world, the earth, the skies, the stars, aliens, humans, animals, whatever fucking bullshit thought that had occurred in my head that makes my skin crawl.",1
254,ptsd,I am afraid of what I am or what I might become.,1
255,ptsd,"I am afraid that I might go crazy or fight that I might become boring, or normal, or average, or weird, or some fucking hippie, or some fucking stupid hard-headed person.",1
256,ptsd,"So, I survived years of physical and sexual abuse as a kid.",1
257,ptsd,I'm finally at the place in my counselling where my therapist and I both think I'm ready to work through it.,1
258,ptsd,"Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger, and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore, and my body felt all weird and flat, my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule, my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it.",1
259,ptsd,Things got better in middle school (thankfully) but it’s sad how literally 5 years as a young child (when life was supposed to be good) were so rough and still affect my life to this day.,1
260,ptsd,My home life wasn’t super bad but school was a living hell.,1
261,ptsd,I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting.,1
262,ptsd,"Sorry for the rant, it’s just sad how cruel teachers and students can be in elementary school.",1
263,ptsd,Bullying in elementary school directly caused so many of my mental health issues.,1
264,ptsd,"And I’ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can’t breathe I’m shaking I’m numb.",1
265,ptsd,"And he is there just reminding me, gently... this isn’t happening right now.",1
266,ptsd,I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive.,1
267,ptsd,My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day.,1
268,ptsd,My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents.,1
269,ptsd,I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it.,1
270,ptsd,"It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either.",1
271,ptsd,"Things are going downhill (not with my eating, which is good!",1
272,ptsd,"), but my PTSD symptoms are loud.",1
273,ptsd,"I'm not sleeping, my self harm has escalated and I'm struggling to leave my house.",1
274,ptsd,I'm also just about to lose my job because the company I work for is going under.,1
275,ptsd,"yesterday, I almost had sex with someone.",1
276,ptsd,"but when it was happening, I felt only halfway there.",1
277,ptsd,"and now my memory of it is hazy, and when I try to think about it I don't see it from my perspective, I see it from like above me.",1
278,ptsd,like it wasn't *actually*happening to me.,1
279,ptsd,Now my treatment has stopped this triggering from happening and sometimes think about moving back.,1
280,ptsd,The past few nights I have been drifting off to sleep and then I get the sensation that I'm falling and jerk awake.,1
281,ptsd,"I've had it happen before to me, but never like 50 times in a row that prevents me from sleeping.",1
282,ptsd,"But I do not even think the therapist is supposed to actually care, she actually seems to, but I cannot understand it.",1
283,ptsd,"I did not start therapy because I thought she would care, I started therapy because I jumped off a bridge 1 year ago and I have an 18 and 21 year old brother and sister who are too young to process a suicide, it would be wrong, so therapy is the thing I figured.",1
284,ptsd,"But another part of me feels tied down these days, I am getting tired of this town and want to pick up my pack and go on down that open road just as I have 16 times in these past 15 years and she is the only reason I don't.",1
285,ptsd,"It feels great, but I'm worried.",1
286,ptsd,I tried to kill myself one year and one month ago.,1
287,ptsd,I am prone to depression.,1
288,ptsd,"I am worried about crashing too hard, and I have kids to care for.",1
289,ptsd,I started to get depressed but was personally unaware.,1
290,ptsd,"My wife started to notice that I wasn't eating, was moody, not sleeping, and laying in bed all day.",1
291,ptsd,She asked me if I was ok and I... broke down.,1
292,ptsd,All emotions came to a tipping point and I started whaling in tears.,1
293,ptsd,I told her I had been thinking about suicide.,1
294,ptsd,I can't decide if it's healthy or not since most of the traumatic things that happened at home were in that space.,1
295,ptsd,"I'll find myself camped out, sobbing on the floor, but can't really pinpoint why it's the place I always seek out.",1
296,ptsd,It sucks.,1
297,ptsd,I know I need help.,1
298,ptsd,I want to get help.,1
299,ptsd,"I was sexually abused throughout my childhood (at least 10 years, possibly longer).",1
300,ptsd,I forgot the memories for a long time but now I'm finally getting them back and it's freaking me out.,1
301,ptsd,My sleep patterns are erratic because I don't want to sleep anymore.,1
302,ptsd,Is it normal to have PTSD with nightmares EVERY time I sleep?,1
303,ptsd,My psychologist has started trying to slowly desensitize me by showing me pictures and videos of what disturbs me: this is currently making things worse.,1
304,ptsd,And my nightmares are a terrifying mix of intense body horror and trauma flashbacks.,1
305,ptsd,So I wake up even more tired and in pain which makes me miserable during the day.,1
306,ptsd,"So now I'm having my chronic pain flaring up, my other PTSD symptoms kicking my ass, my other mental illnesses acting up, and on top of that I'm too tired from the nightmares to do anything about it.",1
307,ptsd,I just can't fucking win.,1
308,ptsd,I'm so so tired.,1
309,ptsd,"Hi everybody, I'm a 22 year old male who has had extreme depression and anxiety issues since I was 12 years old.",1
310,ptsd,And I’m scared all the time.,1
311,ptsd,"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories.",1
312,ptsd,And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating.,1
313,ptsd,I’m sorry.,1
314,ptsd,I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,1
315,ptsd,"my abuser is in my family, and i am in the process of healing but every family reunion/holiday i must see my abuser causing me to enter panic attacks, constant crying, and flashbacks, causing an uproar to what could make me so ""troubled"" I am afraid of coming out to my family in case of being removed for my family forever and damaging relationships.",1
316,ptsd,I have younger family members i am trying to protect so i feel alot of weight on my shoulders when i am having a bad PTSD episode around my abuser and my younger family members.,1
317,ptsd,Also there was an attempted rape on me when I was 21.,1
318,ptsd,I never realised how much an effect these events had on me.,1
319,ptsd,The problem is that I am married even though my marriage is awful.,1
320,ptsd,I grew up believing that everything bad that happened was my fault.,1
321,ptsd,"I have tried so hard to make something of my life after that hell, but now that everything feels like falling apart again I feel like I am breaking.",1
322,ptsd,This must mean that I am truly worthless and a waste of life.,1
323,ptsd,"I feel like I'm not even allowed to feel like this, because I deserve this hard life.",1
324,ptsd,Has anyone experienced horrible burn out because of PTSD/OCD?,1
325,ptsd,"I don’t have anything to ask atm or anything that anyone else need to know, but i cant go to someone when I’m not coping or in a state, I feel like it’s something I have to ride out on my own, that I can’t tell anyone about.",1
326,ptsd,"I hate going throw this on my own, not that my family don’t try to support me, I just don’t want to see mum cry again because I’m broken and she’s tryed every thing she can but nothing helps.",1
327,ptsd,"Iv had more 5 therapist and seen at least that again in one off meeting, but I can’t engage and have developed a vague phobia towards them, I used to hide in the house when I knew I had an appointment and only come out if I was promised I didn’t have to go.",1
328,ptsd,I can’t see my condition changing.,1
329,ptsd,I suffer from PTSD because I have been abused my entire life.,1
330,ptsd,I was physically abused by my teacher when I was 8 years old.,1
331,ptsd,"My mother physically, mentally and emotionally abused me, up until I left her house at 16.",1
332,ptsd,I had a skin graft.,1
333,ptsd,"It hurts, every day.",1
334,ptsd,"Not all the time, but usually when I'm upset or having a hard time.",1
335,ptsd,It'd be nice to know the pain isn't all in my head and maybe it's actually a physical consequence.,1
336,ptsd,It just hurts.,1
337,ptsd,"I thought if I changed, if I did everything for him, he would love me like I wanted him to.",1
338,ptsd,I broke it off a few days ago.,1
339,ptsd,I can't help but feel so guilty for doing so.,1
340,ptsd,"At least when I was 12, that man went to prison for 40 years.",1
341,ptsd,Where you relive your trauma and talk about it to take the emotional response and power away.,1
342,ptsd,I am just nervous and very scared.,1
343,ptsd,"But there is no certainty, and I am so scared I am going to fuck this up.",1
344,ptsd,But none of that seems meaningful in the dead of night when I cannot sleep and get so sad and ruminating.,1
345,ptsd,I just do not know what to do to improve it or fix it.,1
346,ptsd,"I grab my partner and told him “ we need to get out of here right fucking now!” We made hour way out of the building, as we were exiting the conditions increasingly got worse, just as we made the door the room flashover, my partner was already in the hallway I was still in the room.",1
347,ptsd,"Many times when firefighters are caught in a flash over the outcome is death, for me it was burns to years, wrists, and face.",1
348,ptsd,After that I started struggling with anxiety at work and home.,1
349,ptsd,On my days off I started to drink excessively.,1
350,ptsd,I'm currently almost 19 but suffered a lot of traumatic events within my immediate family between the ages of 10-15.,1
351,ptsd,"Earlier this year, I noticed that I had terrible body odor (I shower and wear deodorant everyday) whenever I left the house.",1
352,ptsd,"This was obviously accompanied by some unbearable anxiety, as well as very severe panic attacks.",1
353,ptsd,"I didn't tell anyone, not even my family.",1
354,ptsd,"They didn't know, they didnt know because they couldn't know.",1
355,ptsd,I can't stop feeling miserable.,1
356,ptsd,"It's not even because my ex is going crazy, because he's once again proven I don't get to control my own life.",1
357,ptsd,I can't let go of the prosecutor telling me I only hear what I want.,1
358,ptsd,"I don't even know what he was referring to, but it has to be true because I honestly don't remember agreeing to dismiss he case.",1
359,ptsd,"I'm guess I'm not doing as well as I thought, and I must be as crazy as I now feel.",1
360,ptsd,"I gathered my composure, went back and sulked until I was asked if I could put something in my eye sight to block it out.",1
361,ptsd,"I mentioned I was blocking the signs, she asked why and I said, well, I feel they are kind of negative... And then she told me ""They aren't negative, they are funny, and since you don't think so you should think on if you even want to work here"", walks away and proceeds to tell my boss it isn't working out with me........ all because I expressed that I felt the signs were negative.",1
362,ptsd,Stupid me for thinking dozens and dozens of instant in your face surprise red circles could ever equate to negativity.,1
363,ptsd,Self-esteem hit new lows and had already felt really humiliated about assault before and wanted to tell friends to stop feeling so bad about it and to be able to talk to someone on days when my PTSD got really bad.,1
364,ptsd,"But now I feel even more humiliated about it and feel like anyone that knows is going to see me as damaged, so theres a lot of shame.",1
365,ptsd,I'm also terrified to talk to anyone else about it.,1
366,ptsd,I was recently diagnosed with PTSD (theoretically CPTSD but that's not an official diagnosis so whatever).,1
367,ptsd,It's been 3 years since I escaped my abuser who abused me for 3 years as well.,1
368,ptsd,"However because I was so young (high school/college), people have disregarded the validity of my abuse- which results in me hiding it from the world.",1
369,ptsd,"That sucks, but it's not as bad as what it does to me.",1
370,ptsd,"On top of crippling anxiety about everyday life, I have a terrible fear of commitment that I didn't realize I had until I moved in with my current boyfriend.",1
371,ptsd,"And when I came out of this ""blackout"" I was really groggy and anxious.",1
372,ptsd,I’m struggling to figure out what’s wrong with me at the moment.,1
373,ptsd,"I’m slightly annoyed because before all of this she’s been taking me very seriously and helping with so much, and now I feel like she’s being demeaning?",1
374,ptsd,But I wish I could find a place where it isn't so dark.,1
375,ptsd,Usually after each session I get a headache also.,1
376,ptsd,"I can't tell if i'm becoming worse, because I did EMDR on my bad drug experiences and feel great now.",1
377,ptsd,"The rest of what i'm dealing with is early childhood trauma, which was prolonged so i'm thinking EMDR is just bringing out these feelings and making my body become very unhappy since im reprogramming it to not constantly be hyper aware and anxious.",1
378,ptsd,Ive had a few hospital visits because after some sessions i turn into a hypochondriac because the physical responses are so odd.,1
379,ptsd,One session made the left side of my face numb.,1
380,ptsd,I need quiet and darkness to recover from a major trigger like that.,1
381,ptsd,I went inside and sat in the bathroom with the lights off.,1
382,ptsd,"We had left the radio on in the bedroom and it was blaring so loudly, but I couldn't move I just needed to sit for a little bit.",1
383,ptsd,I thought I had calmed myself back down so I went into our office.,1
384,ptsd,He came into the office all furious.,1
385,ptsd,I can't go anywhere without and inhaler and I tested positive for asthma even though I've never had an issue before all this happened.,1
386,ptsd,I don't know what to do.,1
387,ptsd,I feel like I should go to get psychiatric help but now that I'm in college and only working part time I'm scared of not being able to pay the doctor bills.,1
388,ptsd,I don't know what to do.,1
389,ptsd,I’m really tired.,1
390,ptsd,I get triggered and I have to start all over again.,1
391,ptsd,It’s so hard to see the point in fighting all of this all the time.,1
392,ptsd,I still live with my abuser and sometimes I can make it.,1
393,ptsd,"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often.",1
394,ptsd,My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).,1
395,ptsd,I'm not getting any resources from the VA and I'm not getting better.,1
396,ptsd,"I've been kicked out of the MHICM Range program because ""I'm not making enough progress”—ie not magically getting better.",1
397,ptsd,"After about six months there, my therapist told me I was ""too depressed to help.""",1
398,ptsd,I can't remember what was in the marital home when I left.,1
399,ptsd,I left under duress.,1
400,ptsd,"I am still piecing together weird, incongruous chunks of time, flashbacks, disjointed memories, and trying to figure out what happened; it seems like my brain just can't access specific details when I'd like it to.",1
401,ptsd,"The problem here, other than everything, is that I don't feel like my attorney gets why I'm such a useless participant right now, and I could use some advice on explaining it.",1
402,ptsd,Do I have my therapist call my attorney?,1
403,ptsd,"I am wondering what experiences people have with using Mirtazapine as their main antidepressant for depressive and anxious symptoms (low energy, heavy feeling, irritability, concentration problems, insomnia, inability to complete mundane everyday tasks, social anxiety, fear of embarrassment, worry or overthinking about socialization, etc)?",1
404,ptsd,My depression/anxiety has been building over the past 3 months after a long remission period and due to current circumstances has nearly swung full steam over my everyday life.,1
405,ptsd,"I have the scars, medical records, injuries, memories, and nightmares.",1
406,ptsd,I know it's caused me to suffer from CPTSD.,1
407,ptsd,But has it caused me to lose my mind?,1
408,ptsd,I can't remember agreeing to dismiss.,1
409,ptsd,"I don't understand the response email, and I refuse to assign meaning by reading into her response.",1
410,ptsd,night sweats (bed stinks so bad and I have to wash the sheets daily and my bedroom is 68 degrees and I only sleep with sheets.),1
411,ptsd,night terrors (re-occuring dream: waking up with the feeling that I am supposed to tell someone something to prevent an awful occurrence from happening but unable to say the words.,1
412,ptsd,The words just won't come out) Wife scared to wake me up because I am fearfully jumpy and suffer from panic attacks upon awaking.,1
413,ptsd,depression,1
414,ptsd,I can't be having PTSD from something as mild as what happened even though I have pretty much all the symptoms.,1
415,ptsd,I feel I'm just lying to myself.,1
416,ptsd,I probably just want attention.,1
417,ptsd,"I feel like a huge fraud... How am I even supposed to ""heal"" when I'm probably making everything up, I'm probably not broken, I'm just going to get yelled at again at the new therapy place like my last one because I'll be mute every session (don't even know why, I tell myself ""because I'm not ready to talk about it"" but it's been over 5 years since the last case and all this crap is minor, so it's probably just being ashamed over doing all this crap for god-knows-why when barely anything happened to me...), because ""I'm not trying"".",1
418,ptsd,"I don't even know why I'm posting this, probably just begging for more attention, I've pushed the last true friend I had away a few days ago over my fears of therapy.",1
419,ptsd,"My memory goes, I panic, breakdown, rock back and forth, sit in closets.",1
420,ptsd,It sucks.,1
421,ptsd,But it's kind of relieving at the same time because while I'm broken I'm not choosing to be dramatic.,1
422,ptsd,I'm not just being manipulative.,1
423,ptsd,It's not my fault.,1
424,ptsd,I was sexually abused when I was a kid and I suspect that I have PTSD because of it.,1
425,ptsd,"I've never been diagnosed with PTSD, but I have been diagnosed with agoraphobia.",1
426,ptsd,I rarely leave my house.,1
427,ptsd,"I'm not really anxious about leaving my house and once I get somewhere, I'm usually fine.",1
428,ptsd,I just have a very strong feeling of not being able to leave my house.,1
429,ptsd,"On the off days where I don't remember them I still wake up feeling tired, wake up multiple times.",1
430,ptsd,I just feel like I cant sleep like normal.,1
431,ptsd,Ways to get out of the funk these put me in?,1
432,ptsd,It's really hurting.,1
433,ptsd,I just don't want to hurt anyone but I know deep down that it's me that's hurt.,1
434,ptsd,I really don't know what's wrong with me lately.,1
435,ptsd,It seems like every day I'm having some kind of meltdown and I don't know how to get back to normal.,1
436,ptsd,"The other night I had a massive flashback, no idea what triggered it.",1
437,ptsd,And for about two weeks now I feel constantly on the verge of an anxiety attack.,1
438,ptsd,I was a severe addict that had 2 overdoses when I was younger and addiction/alcoholism runs on both sides of my family.,1
439,ptsd,I don't want to come out of on the other side and be this nervous and uncomfortable person who is unable to have relationships.,1
440,ptsd,"I have been thinking of seeing a therapist, I don't really have the time or extra money, plus I've been really hurt from small intimate AA groups.... Ugh.... Is there another side of this PTSD mental attrition?",1
441,ptsd,"I'm not ready to talk about what happened, but it was pretty recent so even the small things are triggering.",1
442,ptsd,"I'm getting help, but these things take time and I can't just quit the internet.",1
443,ptsd,But it seems like I'm also dealing with abandonment issues with my parents which has recently reemerged after coming out as transgender which they don't support.,1
444,ptsd,"Unfortunately, I have Lyme disease and live with them because I'm too sick to do anything and they won't support my transition.",1
445,ptsd,I get the feeling that if I was healthy and I transitioned I'd never speak to them.,1
446,ptsd,I didn't know that either but I still felt the same.,1
447,ptsd,Also that whole living situation and that man was horrible and stressful anyway (without it being a trigger for something else too).,1
448,ptsd,Why did I open my mouth I should’ve just said “I’m fine” ~ I don’t need help Or maybe I do,1
449,ptsd,I really don't want to talk about what happened.,1
450,ptsd,"But, I really want the nightmares to go away.",1
451,ptsd,"Sorry if this sounds weird, I am really really fucking tired...",1
452,ptsd,I have complex ptsd due to past romantic relationships and some other various traumas in my life.,1
453,ptsd,"(Also diagnosed bipolar, severe social/general anxiety, OCPD) Currently suffering symptoms that and messing with my healthy thought patterns and its tearing apart my current relationship.",1
454,ptsd,I am terribly upset because this is the first partner to really take me as I am (dark side and all) The paranoid feeling that things are going to end has made it almost inevitable.,1
455,ptsd,"But now, I can't.",1
456,ptsd,I have completely given up on getting the correct mental health treatment.,1
457,ptsd,Even after he finished the exam he did another sweep with his hand idk wtf he was checking because we were all done I’m almost positive he just wanted to fucking touch me because every chance he could he would.,1
458,ptsd,"I was so close to tears I know this isn’t like so bad, but to a girl with ptsd from assault it was the end of the world.",1
459,ptsd,I felt so gross and grimy having his nasty hands on me calling me beautiful.,1
460,ptsd,"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories.",1
461,ptsd,And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating.,1
462,ptsd,I’m sorry.,1
463,ptsd,I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,1
464,ptsd,I know my thoughts are disorganized right now and I’m finding it hard to organize them.,1
465,ptsd,"“Fuck it, I’ll just microwave those fuckers and then give myself the decency to have a painless death.” “Ok ok, deep breaths.",1
466,ptsd,That completely threw me.,1
467,ptsd,I don't know why I'm finding it so difficult to cope.,1
468,ptsd,I'm crying frequently for some reason and I don't know why.,1
469,ptsd,I haven't done the whole uncontrollable crying thing since my last episode which was all the way back in November 2016.,1
470,ptsd,(I spent 2017 learning to shut down my emotions so crying had become a thing of the past.),1
471,ptsd,"I know he's never going to be the same, but it's hard seeing him like this.",1
472,ptsd,My brother lashes out when things don't go his way to and just has a nasty attitude at times..,1
473,ptsd,"Until recent years, I rarely got hugs from parents or my brother and when we'd brush legs while sitting, it'd be an awkward ""oh sorry"" and a shuffle to separate.",1
474,ptsd,I feel so worthless on those days.,1
475,ptsd,"I had PTSD for almost a year before going on benzos, but it wasn't until I was put on benzos (and then stupidly chose to continue a do-it-yourself habit) that my mind just happily dissociated - I barely remember the last year.",1
476,ptsd,What in the fuck have I done to myself?,1
477,ptsd,My husband had several things happen to him when he was a teenager and occasionally when things get very bad for him he has very bad flashbacks complete with regression to the time when the trauma happened.,1
478,ptsd,"It is heartbreaking to see, and obviously he does not recognize me and does not understand why we live together and why he’s not living at his parents house Does anyone have experience with this kind of flashbacks?",1

726,ptsd,"I had another friend come out and tap on my window, scaring me.",1
727,ptsd,"He didn’t know what happened, and when he asked me what was wrong I just started to cry.",1
728,ptsd,I felt stupid and ashamed.,1
729,ptsd,"Through the sobs I told him what happened, I even told him that my rapists did it to me.",1
730,ptsd,He was supportive and sweet and it made me feel so much more guilty.,1
731,ptsd,"Hi, I cannot think clearly today.",1
732,ptsd,"I know I have to take care of myself, but its always been an issue.",1
733,ptsd,"I do not shower, the last one was two months ago.",1
734,ptsd,I sleep in my clothes and wear them the next day.,1
735,ptsd,"I do not was my hands, or face.",1
736,ptsd,I literally felt her lose interest in talking to me as I said that.,1
737,ptsd,I told her that it wasnt a waste of my time and that I'm here because I want to get better.,1
738,ptsd,This was only my second time meeting her and we never delved into any of the main issues that I was facing but she brushed me off so quickly all because I wasn't sobbing my eyes out or felf like committing suicide.,1
739,ptsd,She acknowledged the fact that I wanted to stay and talk about other things in therapy but she proceeding to rush me out.,1
740,ptsd,"Here comes a little rant, because I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m done with it.",1
741,ptsd,I keep on having panic attacks and I can’t find the trigger.,1
742,ptsd,"I’ve been crying for hours now, and yesterday and the day before as well.",1
743,ptsd,"I’m seriously afraid that I will go nuts one day, I see no end nor a solution.",1
744,ptsd,I’m afraid I’ll end up in a mental hospital.,1
745,ptsd,"Since then, I've been more conscious of myself doing this and, while it feels like a shameful secret, I continue to do it.",1
746,ptsd,"I know I never did this before, so I'm wondering if it has anything to do with what happened to me.",1
747,ptsd,I feel like I'm the only one.,1
748,ptsd,"I've stopped telling it,  and when someone at work says what's wrong.",1
749,ptsd,I just can't really go out and do stuff.,1
750,ptsd,I keep pushing college back I wanted to be a nurse and now I don't want to do anything but be a hermit and go live in the woods.,1
751,ptsd,"I'm not really looking for responses I'm just tired of people not listening or believing me, I've had it all my life and I'm just done with it.",1
752,ptsd,But I digress.,1
753,ptsd,"In February of this year, I was raped by my (now ex) boyfriend, who also happened to be the only person I've ever had sex with.",1
754,ptsd,I was diagnosed with PTSD in September.,1
755,ptsd,"The rape has flipped my life entirely upside down, and there isn't an hour that goes by where my mind doesn't screw me over with either thoughts of the rape itself or simply just HIM.",1
756,ptsd,And I don't even remember.,1
757,ptsd,He says it's ok and he forgives me.,1
758,ptsd,But it's NOT OKAY.,1
759,ptsd,my diagnoses and the symptoms of it is never an excuse to hurt the ones I love.,1
760,ptsd,But my brain defaulted into my stoned embarrassment.,1
761,ptsd,"Just having this idea people hate me when they don’t, missing my dad and punishing myself for not being able to help my dad through his alcoholism.",1
762,ptsd,Not that he deserves it.,1
763,ptsd,But raping my mom was one of those.,1
764,ptsd,"But damn, I felt really inferior.",1
765,ptsd,"My friends are branching off and doing amazing things, and I feel I’m in the corner just trying to make it through the day, constantly dealing with chronic pain, low immunity, and PTSD.",1
766,ptsd,I’m just having a rough time tonight.,1
767,ptsd,"My counsellor saw me through the window and called me on the phone, trying to distract me so she could send help over to me.",1
768,ptsd,"Campus was pretty much empty, everyone in exams or already finished for the summer and I felt at peace.",1
769,ptsd,Now I’m wishing I didn’t.,1
770,ptsd,"Called two of my friends, but it’s late and they’re asleep.",1
771,ptsd,But this incident has been troubling me for a couple of days now.,1
772,ptsd,I guess I am just sick and tired of my trauma interfering with my relationships.,1
773,ptsd,I feel bad for my boyfriend- he shouldn't have to put up with this stuff.,1
774,ptsd,I know he loves me and he is terribly worried.,1
775,ptsd,But I also feel bad for me.,1
776,ptsd,"I'm not sure why he thinks I want to erode their relationship, this is another thing I'm still thinking about.",1
777,ptsd,This is sorta horrifying to think about because I have absolutely zero romantic interest in him at all and the reason I valued our friendship so much in the first place was because there was no romantic/sexual element.,1
778,ptsd,"I was nice, and it got me no where, so I was rude, it got worse.",1
779,ptsd,"I compliment my mom and my sister as much as I can, I tell my sister I’m proud of her, I tell both of them I love them, I take care of my mom the best I can, but I’m still their verbal punching bag.",1
780,ptsd,"Every day I tell my mom that I love her, that she looks pretty, etc etc, but it ends up in her replying with “you’re gonna fail this year you know that right?",1
781,ptsd,My sister called me naive and immature for not making fun of people’s interests and looks.,1
782,ptsd,Please don't make me feel worse.,1
783,ptsd,"I mean, hell, I'm ashamed I even need to ask my boyfriend.",1
784,ptsd,My mom and sister either do nothing or make it worse.,1
785,ptsd,"My father would abuse me consistently both mentally and physically from i think 4 to 14, maybe earlier.",1
786,ptsd,"I don't really remember what all brought this on, but often it was school related.",1
787,ptsd,"I remember being in a car seat, my mother didn't know what to do so she took me to him (my parents are apart), and i tried to run because i knew what was going to happen, and i remember crying so hard i hyperventilated, my mom promised never to do that again.",1
788,ptsd,"He'd do it because of grades, because i misbehaved.",1
789,ptsd,"And I freak out when staff at the library call cops over us ""being loud"", I freak out over some very minor warrants.",1
790,ptsd,While waiting & the drop in center for the shower she assaults me & I block her blows.,1
791,ptsd,"im so scared of everything around me, whenever I have a panic attack, I can't even call out for help, I just choke on my own breath and cry im just fearful of what's going to happen in the future.",1
792,ptsd,"I'm already seeing a therapist but i've been relapsing so bad since september and i just don't know what to do it's been such a rollercoaster and it just feels hopeless to recover from this im sorry for bothering you guys i just need to talk.. everyone i can talk to is asleep and i wouldnt be able to talk to them even if I could, i feel so numb after the panic attack i had last night, i just..",1
793,ptsd,"Need a talk, a distraction or something, because right now I just feel so.",1
794,ptsd,wrong and out of place,1
795,ptsd,I don't remember everything but i tried to lie to him and he had to drag me to the bathroom and tried to make me throw up.,1
796,ptsd,"The scary thing is that when he went to call the ambulance and i thought i just might die i repeated to myself ""It's finally over"".",1
797,ptsd,I feel afraid to work.,1
798,ptsd,I feel like less of a man because of this.,1
799,ptsd,I worry about my future and if I'll ever get stable ground.,1
800,ptsd,"I don't have any point, I'm just overwhelmed and want to give up.",1
801,ptsd,"I don't want to tell my therapist, I don't want to go to therapy.",1
802,ptsd,It feels artificial and contrived and uneven.,1
803,ptsd,It's sick and twisted.,1
804,ptsd,I've been getting nauseas and I've been having more dissociative flashbacks.,1
805,ptsd,"My nightmares are coming back, but they're mostly of his parents.",1
806,ptsd,"I'm afraid to see them, although my dreams are usually them telling me they understand.",1
807,ptsd,it wasn't my fault it feels like my fault I feel like the reason That mother shouldn't have had to bury her boy I should have been a better friend,1
808,ptsd,But then i couldn't think straight.,1
809,ptsd,now i get flashbacks in school.,1
810,ptsd,"I used to enjoy quantitative courses but now i get tension headaches from the flashbacks, and feelings of horror and hyperarousal.",1
811,ptsd,I just feel so violated and disturbed that it was for fear of his violence that i didn't close the door - and that he was watching me!,1
812,ptsd,"My vagina feels tension too, which i read from a PTSD book is a common symptom.",1
813,ptsd,They would text and call constantly throughout the day begging me to forgive them for hurting me but that  they're in love and love can't be stopped.,1
814,ptsd,They got increasingly angry and started calling me selfish for trying to keep them apart.,1
815,ptsd,After I wrote a bit about the sexual abuse in an anonymous online diary my ex (who knew my username but I thought I had blocked from the site) started harassing me more.,1
816,ptsd,Angrily telling me that I need to stop pretending he raped me and how I wanted everything that happened and that I was just a jealous ex.,1
817,ptsd,"I won't and kinda can't (remember missing pieces of time) go into all the details, but he gaslighted me pretty bad.",1
818,ptsd,Sometimes I'll stop and just stand somewhere or stare until I get snapped out of it.,1
819,ptsd,When I dissociate it's usually a lot more violent and delusional so I thought maybe it was something else.,1
820,ptsd,"I haven't brought it up with my therapist because I just had a meeting with her before learning about this, am I just looking too deep into things?",1
821,ptsd,I only get it when I have a flashback or strong reaction to a trigger.,1
822,ptsd,Also been having lots of nightmares again recently.,1
823,ptsd,"Not sure what to do as I’m not currently in therapy, but I am waiting to be seen at a mental health clinic.",1
824,ptsd,I go through periods where all night I have nightmares and I can’t slee because of them.,1
825,ptsd,"Three years ago I used to be on a medicine that helped with the nightmares, I can’t remember the name though.",1
826,ptsd,But it made me so tired.,1
827,ptsd,My version of events wasn't believed due to ten other witnesses denying it and I was expelled immediately.,1
828,ptsd,I got home and unexpectedly my bags were already packed.,1
829,ptsd,"I'm waiting to tell work about what happened, that I can't come in.",1
830,ptsd,I'm going to the hospital with her.,1
831,ptsd,I don't care if they're mad or if I get fired.,1
832,ptsd,I just feel so shaken and scared still.,1
833,ptsd,I feel like I've taken a giant step back.,1
834,ptsd,"The subsequent criminal trial has made me question my emotional stability, and memories.",1
835,ptsd,"Are the symptoms of CPTSD causing me to fail in my interactions on a day to day basis, or has there simply been a bizarre miscommunication?",1
836,ptsd,I wish I could go back and just not fuck up so horribly.,1
837,ptsd,I was begged not to go out on this date from tinder.,1
838,ptsd,My friend was raped off tinder and told me all guys want are sex off tinder.,1
839,ptsd,I had talked to my assaulter and told him I didn't want to be touched and he was fine with it and seemed perfectly normal.,1
840,ptsd,I'm so stupid.,1
841,ptsd,"I'm new to Reddit and have only really discussed my issues with trauma and PTSD with my partner and therapist, and I am struggling with the random dissociative cycles of derealization and depersonalization.",1
842,ptsd,And I'm so tired of it.,1
843,ptsd,I've been in therapy for half of my life.,1
844,ptsd,"I write and also listen to music to help when I'm having issues, but it never feels like enough.",1
845,ptsd,So I started talking to myself (which I do under stress) and drinking and this was a piece of the conversation:,1
846,ptsd,I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.,1
847,ptsd,It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion.,1
848,ptsd,I know most of you will say ‘you need to leave’ or something obvious - yes I know.,1
849,ptsd,"But things aren’t that easy and than there’s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he, of all people, will change.",1
850,ptsd,I'm afraid of going into too much detail only because I constantly fear that he knows that I talk about him.,1
851,ptsd,"To keep it short, my father was physically violent towards me, my mother, our dog, mistreated all of his animals, leaked our information on shady sites before multiple times, and has made my life a living hell up until I went to court to stop having visitation with him.",1
852,ptsd,"I thought that it wouldn't really affect anything outside of startle reflex, trust issues, etc, but here I am years after my last visit with him and it's still affecting me fucking terribly.",1
853,ptsd,I just sat in bed sobbing for a half hour because I'm afraid of everyone around me.,1
854,ptsd,I'm assuming I have PTSD and my work gave me a number to call and I'm debating doing so.,1
855,ptsd,But I hate asking for help and I feel pathetic because nothing happened.,1
856,ptsd,I'm physically fine.,1
857,ptsd,I just really need advice because I'm struggling on how to feel.,1
858,ptsd,I don't know why I can't just brush this off considering I'm alright.,1
859,ptsd,"However, today I was sitting at work and for whatever reason I started thinking about the knife incident.",1
860,ptsd,"It was a pretty stupid thing to think about, it caused the worst panic attack I've had in months and had to go for a walk around the block to clear my head.",1
861,ptsd,I don't want to feel like a burden to anyone anymore and to myself so the feeling of wanting to die didn't go away.,1
862,ptsd,I don't know how to deal with myself or with other people since I feel like I should just get over it and continue with my life but I can't and I'm 22.,1
863,ptsd,Am I exaggerating?,1
864,ptsd,Am I just so weak that I can't deal with what happened to me that I can't normally continue with my life?,1
865,ptsd,I feel like I'm at the end of my rope here.,1
866,ptsd,I bawl every night because I don't want to feel this never ending pain anymore.,1
867,ptsd,I can't live with what happen to me.,1
868,ptsd,I can't live with the fact that since I didn't go to police that he is preying on another girl like me.,1
869,ptsd,I have so many social problems I dont have friends anymore.,1
870,ptsd,I’m so concerned as we head into warmer months.,1
871,ptsd,"I know I need to leave the area and that’s on my agenda, I just can’t do that before summer comes and goes.",1
872,ptsd,But even the ride from home to office is enough to send me into a spin for about an hour.,1
873,ptsd,"Without my boyfriend who I thought was my best friend, my two female friends who used to always have my back becoming distant, and now not knowing who or what to trust seeing as Nex and I still work in the same industry my PTSD is just skyrocketing off the charts.",1
874,ptsd,"With no roots put back down yet (which I’m working on the living sit) and no one close to turn to emotionally, how the fuck do I go on?",1
875,ptsd,When is enough enough?,1
876,ptsd,When is it too much?,1
877,ptsd,I know giving up is not an option but it is all so overwhelming...,1
878,ptsd,"When it's abuse in the workplace, it seems like everyone just says, ""Oh, get over it, and don't be a baby.",1
879,ptsd,I don't know one other person who goes through shit like this at work or who acts like that - WTF?).,1
880,ptsd,"They just want to brush it off, and no one gives a shit.",1
881,ptsd,Does anyone else experience parts of their PTSD this way?,1
882,ptsd,I tried to do some digging and pin down what I am experiencing so I can communicate with my husband more effectively but it isn't something that seems to fit nicely into a box and so it has been confusing.,1
883,ptsd,"I pushed through and finished my PhD, but now I'm worn, and after looking into it, I've realized that the psychological symptoms of stress I display are closely aligned with racism-specific PTSD.",1
884,ptsd,"I've been through psychotherapy, but I'm not sure the therapist was adequately prepared to identify it, but I know for certain that I have PTSD.",1
885,ptsd,I want to begin healing now that I'm done with grad school.,1
886,ptsd,From the moment I wake up and until I go to sleep I don't feel safe.,1
887,ptsd,When I'm around other people I feel even even more anxious/fearful.,1
888,ptsd,"I know nothing bad is going to happen to me, but I still feel this way.",1
889,ptsd,"I don't really have any friends, and these intense chronic feelings makes it seem impossible to make a real connection with anyone.",1
890,ptsd,I have been considering finally confessing my secret because it feels like I am choking on it.,1
891,ptsd,"I repress it as much as I can, but when it bubbles to the surface, it effects everything in my life.",1
892,ptsd,I need help and I need to find the right way to deal and approach this.,1
893,ptsd,i was sexually assaulted almost 6 months ago.,1
894,ptsd,once i was assaulted i ate nothing for three days straight.,1
895,ptsd,i couldn’t stop losing the weight.,1
896,ptsd,"A couple months after we though she was out of our lives, she broke into our house at 2 am.",1
897,ptsd,"I was playing diablo 2, as at this point in my life I had severe insomnia.",1
898,ptsd,"Had i not been up, My dad had thought I had broken a cup or something and wasnt going to bother checking, I was known for having insomnia at this point in my life already, so she may very well have attacked any one of us that night.",1
899,ptsd,I feel like I've failed.,1
900,ptsd,I keep having this fear that I've made it all up.,1
901,ptsd,"That I made up the rape, and made up the traumatizing feelings, made up the emotions.",1
902,ptsd,"I'm afraid that I just have a very sick, sick dramatic mind that is just making up terrible shit to try and destroy me or something?",1
903,ptsd,But then I get angry so quickly and I feel terrible because I snapped at someone who didn’t deserve it and I just don’t understand where it comes from.,1
904,ptsd,"Or I’ll suddenly start thinking about what happened to me and I’ll get really really depressed, again out of nowhere.",1
905,ptsd,One minute I’m functioning okay and the next I seem like someone else.,1
906,ptsd,I don’t know if this is a symptom of my PTSD or if there’s something else mentally wrong with me that’s being piled on top of the PTSD.,1
907,ptsd,I was just recently diagnosed so I guess I’m still trying to figure out what’s the PTSD and what’s just me losing my mind.,1
908,ptsd,"So im m15 im still in school ive been through abuse when i was a kid it scarred my head i live with my mum now but i usually roam in woods playing guitar, i got diagnosed when i was 14 shit sucks gives me flashbacks whenever i close my eyes, my mind scans every goddamn thing in the area every fucking thing!, i just dont know how to explain its so complicated my brain acts weird at times i just need to know wtf is happening with me!",1
909,ptsd,"My mom never threw books at me, but the impact of something along with the name-calling was enough.",1
910,ptsd,I ran to my room and I honestly don't remember what I did.,1
911,ptsd,"I remember my attack going on for hours, but everything else is blurry.",1
912,ptsd,"I'm scared, and I've been on edge for the past few days.",1
913,ptsd,"My ex is claiming self-defense, even though I wasn't attacking him.",1
914,ptsd,"I'm way too small of a person, it doesn't even make sense.",1
915,ptsd,"He towers over me, how does he expect people to believe him?",1
916,ptsd,"No wonder I get scolded for bad grades, called a lazy, worthless piece of fuck because I am too lazy or too stupid to care about exams and my future, but in reality, I deeply care too much as if I feel like the whole fucking world of 7 billion people, and millions or billions of other organisms are on my shoulders ... and all I can do is to shut down entirely.",1
917,ptsd,"I shut down by brain, my thoughts, my emotions, everything because I cannot take all the anxiety.",1
918,ptsd,All the fear and terror.,1
919,ptsd,Sometimes I feel as depressed as if I am a lonely guy in a post-apocalyptic setting where everyone is either dead or absent or gone.,1
920,ptsd,I’m going to kill myself.,1
921,ptsd,I can’t take this anymore.,1
922,ptsd,"I was doing so much fucking better lately, and just like a snap of a finger, I am disassociating harder then I ever have before.",1
923,ptsd,"It comes out of nowhere, when I’m having an other wise good day.",1
924,ptsd,No anxiety or depression but out of nowhere I get extremely disassociated.,1
925,ptsd,"I loved this person dearly with all my heart, and it was an extremly tragic and sudden death.",1
926,ptsd,I want to go to my doctor but im already in counceling.,1
927,ptsd,"My stress tolerance was already at a zero and I was contemplating suicide a lot, i didn’t want to see where that would lead me and I didn’t want to do that to my brothers.",1
928,ptsd,"He’s helping me through the problems of getting rehabilitation welfare, which is a hassle because I constantly have to talk to new counselors, psychologists and psychiatrists which triggers breakdowns.",1
929,ptsd,"I hate talking about myself to strangers, I’m not ashamed at all, I just hate having to share how I truly feel with strangers.",1
930,ptsd,I self harm sometimes too.,1
931,ptsd,"I’ve also lately begun to have constant, daily, and explicit nightmares about tarantulas, roaches, and beetles crawling over me while I’m paralyzed.",1
932,ptsd,"I’m asking bc I don’t want the therapist to yell at me or call me a liar like the last few did, so I’m low key nervous and I don’t want to get in any more trouble with my school.",1
933,ptsd,"Its hard knowing that everyone around you doesn't have these issues, It's hard that it takes an extreme amount of work just to make a normal day in life go by smoothly(which it almost never does) At first I felt like I had a grasps on this whole PTSD thing because it made sense when I first got diagnosed but the longer it's been the harder this is to deal with.",1
934,ptsd,Do you know what it's like to constantly feel uncomfortable in your own skin but you can never turn it off?,1
935,ptsd,"I find myself drinking more than i'd like to admit,I never drank before this, anything to take the edge off.",1
936,ptsd,"I feel like I'm having to teach myself everything all over again, I don't even know how to formulate that into words.",1
937,ptsd,I am worried that I may have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder due to a few notable symptoms/issues that I experience.,1
938,ptsd,"(I also have one notable traumatic experience involving an accident my father was in, he got hit by a bus when I was seventeen and almost died, which I do have nightmares and flashbacks of, but that is a different story.)",1
939,ptsd,"Some days I can't hear music from that time period, watch a show that's remotely emotional, or just sit without tearing up.",1
940,ptsd,"I've never been to see a shrink, although I know I should of, due to past experiences and money issues.",1
941,ptsd,I was diagnosed with PTSD and told I should talk to someone.,1
942,ptsd,I don't know where to go usually.,1
943,ptsd,Especially on nights like these where I can't be quiet without thinking about that night or breaking down in tears.,1
944,ptsd,It made me feel so... small.,1
945,ptsd,"After I left, I felt angry, really fucking angry.",1
946,ptsd,"I don't want to call the office and make a fuss, I want it behind me.",1
947,ptsd,I'm just angry that someone could really think that way.,1
948,ptsd,I'm angry.,1
949,ptsd,I had a panic attack and broke down crying in front of my mom.,1
950,ptsd,She scheduled me an appointment for therapy and I just feel like bleh.,1
951,ptsd,I dont care about getting better right now.,1
952,ptsd,My whole body is in shock from that panic attack and I just feel like death.,1
953,ptsd,I honestly doubt I will get better,1
954,ptsd,"I am no longer ashamed of what happened to me, but I still don't feel like I'm healing.",1
955,ptsd,"I was hoping that these flashbacks and the anxiety, fear and dread would go away over time, but they haven't.",1
956,ptsd,I made a mistake as a result of being shaken up.,1
957,ptsd,Now she has complained to my boss but has falsely amplified my one mistake into me being absolutely negligent and incompetent.,1
958,ptsd,"I found out about this 8 hours ago, had another flashback/panic attack, and my heart is still pounding.",1
959,ptsd,I've convinced myself I'm going to get fired.,1
960,ptsd,I know I need to go back to counseling.,1
961,ptsd,And it literally makes me feel 10k x crazier than I already feel as it is.,1
962,ptsd,"She left me alone, meds unfilled, and then told all her colleagues I was trying to scam ADHD medication off of her, so now none of them want to take my case either.",1
963,ptsd,"They’re like flashbacks and everything I hated that he did , I want this new person to do to me to the point where I break down again.",1
964,ptsd,What the fuck is wrong with me please.,1
965,ptsd,These are violent degrading fantasies and they make me feel like a really disturbed person.,1
966,ptsd,The thought after an orgasm literally makes me cry.,1
967,ptsd,"Dealing with ptsd from rape, and recently found out that someone who I thought was a friend sexually assaulted one of our friends at a party we were at.",1
968,ptsd,"I get flashbacks of waking up whenever we were at parties together and I've seen him awake once or twice and even though the likelyhood is very low (given the background of what he did), I can't shake the feeling that he mightve done something to me.",1
969,ptsd,What he did to her is giving me feelings like what happened to her was actually me.,1

1056,ptsd,I can't teach my therapists how to do their job nor should I feel like I need to in the first place.,1
1057,ptsd,I also have chronic illnesses which makes it tiring (if not at times impossible) to have to constantly fight back against all my doctors to make sure they actually treat me and my symptoms and not just the numbers on my chart.,1
1058,ptsd,It's gotten to the point where I'm really pessimistic about getting better or even being able to get good help.,1

1083,ptsd,"I'm sorry, but in the therapies I've taken and in the books I have to help me, nothing *anywhere* says anything about gratitude and it tends to trigger me when he says this because it's what my narcy mom would say to me.",1
1084,ptsd,"I tried to explain this and asked him to read my books and he got mad at me because in his mind I was trying to tell him what to do and I was being ""ungrateful"" for his help.",1

1096,ptsd,I don't have the ability to cope with it anymore.,1
1097,ptsd,"I'm trying, but a lot of things are triggering me, and I'm shutting down at work, just finding the place I feel safest, and staying there for an hour or two until I feel like I can do something again.",1
1098,ptsd,"I'm tired of watching my back, tired of traveling to places I don't feel safe, tired of reliving that moment, tired of being triggered, tired of the stress, tired of anxiety and knots in my stomach, tired of irrational thought when triggered, tired of irrational paranoia.",1

1113,relationships,I need a place to vent and place my feelings because I don't know what to do anymore.,1
1114,relationships,I don't know how to explain this to her.,1
1115,relationships,I guess maybe this has to do with how I am socially awkward in the past but I've also been told that I am trying too hard.,1

1126,relationships,It’s breaking my heart.,1
1127,relationships,I'm just scared to death.,1
1128,relationships,I'm worried he'll see me and change his mind about me and I don't know what to do.,1
1129,relationships,This has made me really question where I am and if I should be staying put.,1
1130,relationships,But I also don't know if now I'm just second guessing because I'm just generally concerned about the future.,1
1131,relationships,Above all I just have no idea what to do.,1

1146,relationships,"I apologized for taking up too much of his time and space and for not respecting his boundaries, and for storming off angry; the worst part is that he eventually said he didn't accept my apology because I was still ruining his day with my insistence he apologize for speaking to me with a ""retarded"" voice.",1
1147,relationships,"Am I crazy, or do we need to break up?",1

1589,survivorsofabuse,I am so fucked.,1
1590,survivorsofabuse,Is this common?,1
1591,survivorsofabuse,How did you deal with it?,1

1634,survivorsofabuse,When he got drunk he would literally switch back and forth to being happy and giggly to wanting to die and hating himself.,1
1635,survivorsofabuse,This is an idea that my father also reinforced in me heavily.,1
1636,survivorsofabuse,"I remember vividly when I told him that everything was my fault (in my child mind obviously meaning ""you make everything my fault"" which was very much the state of things in the house growing up) and he straight up told me to stop fucking up so much if I didn't want things to be my fault (I should emphasize all ""fuck ups"" were minor- letting a pack of strawberries go to waste, forgetting to call him as soon as I left school, etc- but punished severely).",1
1637,survivorsofabuse,"Hell, even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim.",1

1657,survivorsofabuse,It sucks even more because I won't be able to see my therapist this week because of the 4th of July holiday.,1
1658,survivorsofabuse,I'm so shaken up over this.,1
1659,survivorsofabuse,Even though we did break up I don't know if he's taking it seriously and if he just thinks I'll come home and we'll be ok.,1
1660,survivorsofabuse,I'm so tired of being treated like shit by everyone in my life.,1
1661,survivorsofabuse,"I'm not strong enough to take care of myself, to fight back, to leave.",1
1662,survivorsofabuse,"And I can't work, I can't even answer phone calls because of my anxiety, how am I supposed to survive?",1
1663,survivorsofabuse,"My family doesn't understand my mental issues so I can't get help from them with it, they tell me I need to start looking for a job and I can't even say anything.",1

1669,survivorsofabuse,"Me and my Dad aren't on speaking terms, however we do live in the same house.",1
1670,survivorsofabuse,Mainly because I'm not financially able to leave and live on my own.,1
1671,survivorsofabuse,"I do plan on leaving, but until I make enough money to do so I'm stuck here.",1
1672,survivorsofabuse,"I want to share what has led to this point, because to be honest I feel like I'm pathetic, weak in incapable of accomplishing anything.",1
1673,survivorsofabuse,Everything I do to move forwards seems to be halted and I feel like I'm being pushed back.,1

1685,survivorsofabuse,"I went from hating and fearing my father (since the incident with my sister, which had ended up triggering the memory of being told that I was to blame for the marital issues, among other things) to the point I couldn't even be around him at family or friend gatherings without feeling anxious and wanting to flee, to being able to accept the things that happened in the past, and remind myself that they are in the past, and be able to interact with him again, even if I don't really feel any familial love for him anymore.",1
1686,survivorsofabuse,"I care about him, his wellbeing, but...  That familial bond isn't there, he killed it the he came to retrieve his stuff, a couple days after walking out...",1

1689,survivorsofabuse,It seemed like there was no recognition of my emotional state and like he just wanted me to be quiet.,1
1690,survivorsofabuse,That scares me.,1
1691,survivorsofabuse,"He claims he was trying to help comfort me, but I really am having trouble believing that.",1
1692,survivorsofabuse,This is the second time something like this has happened.,1
1693,survivorsofabuse,The first time was when we were arguing and it was getting really heated.,1
1694,survivorsofabuse,"But it hit close to home when my own parents have pressured me over the years to reconcile with my brother, angrily demanding how I'd handle their funerals, whether I'd insist on not going (I wouldn't.",1

1708,survivorsofabuse,I am angry I can't e joy my life without him showing up randomly.,1
1709,survivorsofabuse,When I went back the next day he said the good news was he wasn't going to lie to me anymore.,1
1710,survivorsofabuse,"He said ""if you can take a raping like that and still come back, there's nothing I could do to make you leave.""",1

1714,survivorsofabuse,"It was the same therapist I'd been seeing since I was little, when I was first diagnosed as ASD (at the time termed PDD-NOS, as I didn't *quite* fit the diagnostic requirements for Aspergers), and she, had honestly stopped being helpful.",1
1715,survivorsofabuse,"Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse.",1
1716,survivorsofabuse,"Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started.",1
1717,survivorsofabuse,"So, I eventually stopped going.",1
1718,survivorsofabuse,"And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.",1
1719,survivorsofabuse,He knew about this.,1

1923,survivorsofabuse,If he had shown even a glimmer of interest in his child or our marriage I could justify more time...but he didn't,1

1952,survivorsofabuse,Now at 30 years old I went to a therapist.,1
1953,survivorsofabuse,I found out that my behaviors are probably caused by suppressing my memories and not finding proper closure from the incident because it’s as if I’m still taking the blame for an abuse that was done to me.,1
1954,survivorsofabuse,He purposely said the most hurtful things to me during our break up to make himself feel better.,1
1955,survivorsofabuse,"And one of the worst things of all, like I mentioned earlier, he sexually assaulted and that also happened when he knew we were breaking up.",1
1956,survivorsofabuse,"Knowing how terrible of a person he is that some people have even told me he is a narcissist or sociopath, I don't know why I still think I should have just stayed, why I should have just seen if he could change despite how he never tried to change throughout our years together.",1

1962,survivorsofabuse,It wasn't enough.,1
1963,survivorsofabuse,"The same negativity, the same feelings of selfhatred, of self-disgust, of ***believing*** everything my father had dumped on me slowly took over.",1
1964,survivorsofabuse,"Some examples: spit on me randomly in the eye doctor's office, giggled and strolled off when I looked up at him in horror.",1
1965,survivorsofabuse,"We had some verbal exchange in the hallway and he slapped me so hard I couldn't feel the tear roll down my cheek my face was so numb, he pinned me to the floor one day and savagely beat me for at least 7 minutes straight for what reason i forget, after he was done beating me up he would punch in the back of the head repeatedly, this gave me headaches and i saw flashes with each blow.",1
1966,survivorsofabuse,And he would often have a gleeful look on his face after he was done.,1

1972,survivorsofabuse,Did anyone ever ask if you were okay?,1
1973,survivorsofabuse,Do you forgive me?,1
1974,survivorsofabuse,Trauma changed the trajectory of my life.,1
1975,survivorsofabuse,But I don't know if I would feel this way about my options if I wasn't anxious and wounded.,1
1976,survivorsofabuse,"My ex and I broke up because he never liked to leave the house, even for daytime activities.",1

1978,survivorsofabuse,Am I going to feel like I do now?,1

1980,survivorsofabuse,And she doesn't even like talking on the phone and just texts.,1

1989,survivorsofabuse,Those are all the ones I can coherently explain.,1

2011,survivorsofabuse,The problem is I've recently moved to Japan on my own and have no one to talk to here.,1
2012,survivorsofabuse,I would normally talk to my boyfriend but he's not awake and I don't even know what I'd say to him - I don't even feel like I can say anything out loud even if I was with him.,1
2013,survivorsofabuse,So I let myself get sucked in and...,1
2014,survivorsofabuse,The incident that occured was that I threw a fit - my arms and legs thrashing in all directions.,1
2015,survivorsofabuse,"I had no idea what was happening, I came out of it terrified and there was one guy left in the room.",1
2016,survivorsofabuse,This guy told me I was possessed by an evil spirit.,1

2025,survivorsofabuse,Again I buried it all to be dealt with at a more convenient time.,1
2026,survivorsofabuse,I have now been working in a job that don't mind for the last year and 3 months.,1
2027,survivorsofabuse,I found that November and December were a struggle and because of that I planned to address my stuff by going to therapy starting in 2019.,1
2028,survivorsofabuse,It is not like her - even when she was that age - to succumb to pressure like that.,1
2029,survivorsofabuse,"I'm trying really hard not to victim blame and immediately feel guilt when I think that way but, again, knowing my wife how I know her - as someone that's not afraid to call BS- it just makes it hard to conceive how she went along with it for so long, knowing that it made her uncomfortable, knowing that it was escalating, and then it was actual happening and her not saying no.",1
2030,survivorsofabuse,I just can't believe these things happened on repeated occasions.,1
2031,survivorsofabuse,"I can absolutely see him pressuring her once, her not knowing how to respond when it happened, and then her saying ""This is BS, I'm out"" afterwards.",1
2032,survivorsofabuse,But that she stuck around and let it happen multiple times just seems odd to me.,1

2034,survivorsofabuse,Somewhere under all the anger about my mum making an issue out of nothing there's something that makes me wonder if it *is* a big deal.,1
2035,survivorsofabuse,Maybe I'm just pretending I don't care?,1
2036,survivorsofabuse,Maybe none of this even happened?,1
2037,survivorsofabuse,I just don't know anymore.,1

Each and everyday is a constant struggle and I am tired of drs telling me to be strong and just get on with life...I am 26years old for 20years I have had to be strong and ""survive"" well I'm tired of surviving...that doesn't mean I want to die but I do want it all to stop, I want to <url> to be happy and trust people, to realise what love is, I mean I have an amazing partner who loves me dearly but I question him every damn day...you see he doesn't hurt me and love...well as my Dad taught me...love is to hurt and lie....but that isn't love at all is it?",1

2060,survivorsofabuse,I'm really unsure how to deal with it.,1
2061,survivorsofabuse,"Also, I'm not sure if I should tell anyone because that couldn't have happened right and it could not have been that bad?",1
2062,survivorsofabuse,I feel like these experiences have totally altered my psyche and now i find gratification through exploitation.,1
2063,survivorsofabuse,I even had the painful realization that ive never had any normal sexual relationship and these abuses are all i know.,1
2064,survivorsofabuse,"I broke down the other night just crying realizing that i dont get to be normal, and that i have sick urges.",1
2065,survivorsofabuse,"I heard that theres high rates of abused people become abusers too, and i hate that im part of the issue.",1
2066,survivorsofabuse,"Tl;Dr: I was abused and now i abuse, what can i do to cope?",1
2067,survivorsofabuse,I'd wake up in the middle of the night to him feeling my ass and masturbating.,1
2068,survivorsofabuse,"I was scared, and didn't know what to do so I just pretended not to notice.",1
2069,survivorsofabuse,"I can't even remember how long this must have went on, but soon enough I had decided to put my pillow on the other side of the mattress, because he'd touch me when I sleep on my side.",1
2070,survivorsofabuse,"I thought putting my pillow on the other side of the bed will help because as I fall asleep and turn on my left side my back will be towards the wall, and he won't be able to reach.",1
2071,survivorsofabuse,I even remember him asking me the next day why I'd decided to move my pillow to the other side of the mattress.,1

2142,domesticviolence,I was yelled at so much I could see the veins bulging in his neck as he swore at me and called me names.,1
2143,domesticviolence,I held my hands over the children’s ears so they couldn’t hear.,1
2144,domesticviolence,But at least he didn’t hit me.,1
2145,domesticviolence,I was told repeatedly that I would be stabbed in the throat so he didn’t need to hear my voice.,1
2146,domesticviolence,"My father has: Keys to a fancy car, like 5 fancy bikes, an iPad, member of a fitness center, goes to the sauna regularily, other women... Needless to say, they should just break up immediately, right?",1
2147,domesticviolence,"Well, it should be that simple, but my mother resists for some reason.",1
2148,domesticviolence,"We had this situation countless times, where she was like, I cannot cope with this anymore, let's find another place to live in, until you find something for yourself, and when things are about to happen, she goes nah, I don't know...",1
2149,domesticviolence,Which is so frustrating to hear after a while.,1
2150,domesticviolence,"Even more so, when he says things like HE decides when or if they split up.",1
2151,domesticviolence,"He came to the door, drunk and high on opiates (he’s an ex H addict, opiate rage is real), he told me, verbatim, that if there was a guy in the house, he’d kill him on the spot, no questions asked.",1
2152,domesticviolence,That was a pretty easy night.,1
2153,domesticviolence,I’ve spent countless nights barricaded in my bedroom because of his rage.,1
2154,domesticviolence,His past is terrible.,1
2155,domesticviolence,Grew up in gangs (Mexican Mafia) and molested at a young age.,1
2156,domesticviolence,Sorry in advance for what I'm getting off me chest.,1
2157,domesticviolence,"This man sexually, physically, and emotionally abused me for a year.",1
2158,domesticviolence,He even tried to marry me at 16 so he could trap me in his perverted hell.,1
2159,domesticviolence,"After four months of completely breaking free of this sick, twisted human being he had the gall to contact one of my friends to try to get a vinyl back.",1
2160,domesticviolence,He treated me like a dog.,1
2161,domesticviolence,"It's late and I should be sleeping but I can't get my husband out of my head, he's just such a freaking weirdo.",1
2162,domesticviolence,"I feel alone in my situation because most abuse involves some level of anger, but for me my suffering was just his way of showing me affection.",1
2163,domesticviolence,"He would always love to wrestle and tickle torture me, and he wouldn't stop when I was screaming at him to stop I no longer live with him but even today I still get a little flinchy.",1
2164,domesticviolence,"I lived in fear of being tackled, pinned, and tickled on a routine basis.",1
2165,domesticviolence,"I resent him for making me feel so small and fearful and at the same time he made me feel like I was crazy, that I was overreacting.",1
2166,domesticviolence,He says he doesn’t remember this happening.,1
2167,domesticviolence,But he has a short fuse as it is.,1
2168,domesticviolence,"He’s temperamental, out of work, depressed, has a family history of substance abuse, and was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2.",1
2169,domesticviolence,I truly believed this would be “rock bottom” and serve as a wake up call to turn his life around.,1
2170,domesticviolence,It wasn’t.,1
2171,domesticviolence,"I don't know if I'm able to do that, since I didn't tell the doctor the truth to begin with.",1
2172,domesticviolence,"I will say that my doctor very clearly didn't believe me at my follow up appointment, but my bf was in the waiting room.",1
2173,domesticviolence,So I didn't admit to anything.,1
2174,domesticviolence,"I was teary eyed, however.",1
2175,domesticviolence,From anyone's experience- is it worth it to go to the police?,1
2176,domesticviolence,at some point they laughed and i had to leave because i got physically sick to my stomach.,1
2177,domesticviolence,i guess i didn't realize how much they had screwed me up.,1
2178,domesticviolence,now i feel like shit though because the acquaintance is a nice person and i want to be friends with them.,1
2179,domesticviolence,we were all planning a dnd game together over text for a while and i just want to be able to talk to them without thinking about my ex.,1
2180,domesticviolence,any solutions or help ideas?,1
2181,domesticviolence,I'm so used to being forced to submit to him that I no longer have a voice.,1
2182,domesticviolence,He heavily favors my sister over me and would buy her anything she wanted in a heartbeat.,1
2183,domesticviolence,An example would be at Darvin furniture one time.,1
2184,domesticviolence,He takes me and my sister there and tells her to pick out a desk.,1
2185,domesticviolence,I look at a $100 discount desk and he says we don't have enough money.,1
2186,domesticviolence,Both of these were poor choices.,1
2187,domesticviolence,It just exacerbated the situation.,1
2188,domesticviolence,"I had vases, game controllers, tv remote, coffee mugs, etc thrown at me on varied encounters.",1
2189,domesticviolence,This is not an exaggerated list..,1
2190,domesticviolence,"I tried to leave and she blocked the door with her body, threatening to kill herself on one such occassion.",1
2191,domesticviolence,"In his own ways I know he loves me but he's double my body weight, he's a weight lifter, and he has blind rage that only comes out on me of all people .",1
2192,domesticviolence,If I keep gambling he could permanently damage me.,1
2193,domesticviolence,I'm in healthcare I know these numbers so WHY?,1
2194,domesticviolence,I like to believe that he knows his limits when we're fighting but he has scared me and himself in the past.,1
2195,domesticviolence,"Now that chokings are happening during every incident, the accidents could be irreversible.",1
2196,domesticviolence,We ate and he was monitoring my data use because I sent some photos to our friend of her baby shower.,1
2197,domesticviolence,"And he said he ""hates having to watch over me like a father and he wishes I was more responsible"" but said that he ""accepts that this is the way I am"" I said nothing in response to this and just ate my food and let it slide, smiled at him and small talked.",1
2198,domesticviolence,We got back to the park and they had put out a new sign saying they were closed for the rest of the day.,1
2199,domesticviolence,This made him even more mad.,1
2200,domesticviolence,I have never before felt so betrayed by the system.,1
2201,domesticviolence,Fiance (f) was blackout drunk.,1
2202,domesticviolence,"She started getting physical by grabbing my genitals and pulling so hard I now have a 1.5"" tear in my scrotum.. after that I was punched, bitten, scratched, and kicked over the next 5 minutes.",1
2203,domesticviolence,"All I could do was try to retreat, but I was unable to get to our room so I could get dressed and leave the house (I was nude at the time).",1
2204,domesticviolence,"As I got scared she would seriously hurt me, or I would strike her back, I grabbed my phone and dialed 911.",1
2205,domesticviolence,I even pressed chargers against him.,1
2206,domesticviolence,Unfortunately he still found a way through to me by hooking up with girls that I know and having them make sure I knew about it.,1
2207,domesticviolence,Nothing has happened since June and I’m about to be moving far away from him.,1
2208,domesticviolence,I struggle with what he did to me every day and the flashbacks occur still.,1
2209,domesticviolence,I don’t expect this to ever fully go away but I am 18 now and I can say that I survived this.,1
2210,domesticviolence,"I've told her each time to stop, she apologised but doesn't see what the big deal is because she ""hasn't been in love with me for a long time.""",1
2211,domesticviolence,This is when I started to feel awful.,1
2212,domesticviolence,I can't fully figure out why though because Im not in love with her - I probably hate her and haven't realised it yet.,1
2213,domesticviolence,I just feel terrible.,1
2214,domesticviolence,I can barely get out of bed to go to uni.,1
2215,domesticviolence,So now they are querying whether he has a traumatic brain injury suffered a year before we got together and that now he has progressing brain damage.,1
2216,domesticviolence,"At this point my nurse self kicks in, I can't not help someone in that situation.",1
2217,domesticviolence,I feel sorry for him I don't want him to be hurt or alone.,1
2218,domesticviolence,But I also want to hate him and leave.,1
2219,domesticviolence,So my incredibly long winded question to you is this: if he has brain damage is this an excuse or a reason?,1
2220,domesticviolence,"So a bit of long back story here, I was adopted as a child not a proper legal adoption, there was a residency order for me to live with my aunt and uncle for an underdetermined amount of time, after a year my aunt and uncle split and my uncle kept me (my aunt was the one I was actually related to) social services never really got involved past this point.",1
2221,domesticviolence,"My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer.",1
2222,domesticviolence,"My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill, I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.",1
2223,domesticviolence,He would play really loud music on the speaker.,1
2224,domesticviolence,It got so bad when he threw the living room table at me.. we got kicked out of at least 4 apartments.,1
2225,domesticviolence,At this point we were homeless.,1
2226,domesticviolence,"He wouldn’t get a job, and wanted me to get out and hold a sign and pan handle for money, if I didn’t he would drive the car we lived in really fast and say he was going to kill us.",1
2227,domesticviolence,He wrecked that car (small wrecks) at least ten times.,1
2228,domesticviolence,"The husband's voice sounds like pure rage, the wife's both angry and defensive.",1
2229,domesticviolence,A couple of times there were sounds of broken objects.,1
2230,domesticviolence,"We have never really talked (they don't speak good English), so I'm not sure how to approach them about it.",1
2231,domesticviolence,"Calling the police feels excessive, but I'm also worried someone might be abused.",1
2232,domesticviolence,What is an appropriate thing to do here?,1
2233,domesticviolence,"I knew that he was scary when he would pray in front of me, yet the entire thing was an angry ATTACK on God (not trying to get into beliefs here, just what happened.)",1
2234,domesticviolence,"I knew he knew how wrong he was when he told me one day to not tell anyone but that he actually HAD threatened suicide in front of his ex wife with a knife, yet still painted her as the evil doer in the story.",1
2235,domesticviolence,I knew he was lying when he made sure to tell me about how crazy one of his exes went at the end accusing him of rape (why would he even bring it up!!),1
2236,domesticviolence,"and how after he took another ex home from injury while we were together, that she might try to lie to me and say that something happened, but NOTHING did!",1
2237,domesticviolence,"It gave me chills when this man would tell me if his ex wasn't his child's mother he would have had her murdered long ago, and that he had friends offer to help!",1
2238,domesticviolence,Extra: Apparently he was jailed before marrying my mom and he never told us until she found out later into the marriage.,1
2239,domesticviolence,There's more into the story but I would like to know if I can file a charge on him for past incidents as well.... and I am upset that he is going to be charged for misdeamenor instead of felony.,1
2240,domesticviolence,"Since the victim (my mom) has enough evidences, it will be hard for him to drop the charges right?",1
2241,domesticviolence,He has been avoiding the police so it took a while for the police to catch him but he paid for the bail and bailed himself out with a help of his friend.,1
2242,domesticviolence,I just wished he would recieve a felony but he pleaded not guilty on the first court appearance and apparently there are more court appearances to be made befoe verdict is finalized....,1
2243,domesticviolence,I spent six years in a very abusive relationship.,1
2244,domesticviolence,We had a child together.,1
2245,domesticviolence,"After she was born, I made my way out.",1
2246,domesticviolence,I ended up fleeing several houses and apartments trying to stay away from him.,1
2247,domesticviolence,There’s been a long history.,1
2248,domesticviolence,I mean what are you suppose to do when your son is 5 and his older brother who is 16 is picking on him.,1
2249,domesticviolence,He was too big for them to punish.,1
2250,domesticviolence,"So I endured it , some days I hate my whole family for never saying anything.",1
2251,domesticviolence,They just were okay with me being scared of my brother constantly.,1
2252,domesticviolence,Fast forward to me being 18 living with my other brother.,1
2253,domesticviolence,He wouldn't take me to the hospital but I could feel the gaping wound in the back of my head and the hole in my lip my tooth had done.,1
2254,domesticviolence,He kept packing.,1
2255,domesticviolence,So I called the police.,1
2256,domesticviolence,I couldn't see out of my left eye and clearly couldn't drive and felt I had no other option.,1
2257,domesticviolence,The police department chose not to press charges.,1
2258,domesticviolence,If they weren't done he would get angry at her.,1
2259,domesticviolence,After that he would borrow money from her while he was making a lot of money.,1
2260,domesticviolence,"Instead of paying her back, he would spend both his income and her money on things he wanted.",1
2261,domesticviolence,"The next thing was that he would say things like ""I'll do this for you but you'll owe me a blow job later.""",1
2262,domesticviolence,While that worried me the next sign really made me concerned.,1
2263,domesticviolence,I don't know if I should call it abuse.,1
2264,domesticviolence,Fiancé suffers from PTSD & alcoholism... Punched me and threw shit at me at an international airport and almost got himself kicked off the flight.,1
2265,domesticviolence,Last night was the 2nd time but far worse.,1
2266,domesticviolence,He beat me with a bag he thought I packed and thought I was going to leave him (it was a bag I forgot to unpack and was in the closet).,1
2267,domesticviolence,My head was bleeding profusely and I (thank goodness) ran outside and called for help...,1
2268,domesticviolence,He causes emotional pain to me every day but I cannot get myself to leave him.,1
2269,domesticviolence,He physically abuses me sometimes but it rarely leaves a mark or bruise.,1
2270,domesticviolence,I feel like even if he cheats on me (again) I still won’t want to leave him.,1
2271,domesticviolence,The only way I think I will leave him forever is if I end up hating him.,1
2272,domesticviolence,And the only way I will hate him is if he caused physical harm that I cannot lie my way out of like I have in the past.,1
2273,domesticviolence,"""I understand as a woman why you are doing this.",1
2274,domesticviolence,"But as a mother, I am begging you not to press charges.",1
2275,domesticviolence,It will ruin his life.,1
2276,domesticviolence,"Please, let us take care of him.",1
2277,domesticviolence,We'll set him straight.,1
2278,domesticviolence,- kicked me out of the house and was going to make me leave in the middle of the night multiple times while insulting me and hitting me I'm sorry to even post this here but I need a little support right now.,1
2279,domesticviolence,He said this to me two nights ago and came into our guest bedroom where I was sleeping the next day and said sorry Kind of.,1
2280,domesticviolence,I tried to talk to him about it and he said he was under a lot of stress and that he doesn't need my love or support and he doesn't want to talk about it.,1
2281,domesticviolence,Super sorry for the fucked up formatting but y'all get the idea...,1
2282,domesticviolence,I need to know what to do.,1
2283,domesticviolence,"A psychopathic family member was promised MY house, for some strange fucking reason, for apparently a very long time now.",1
2284,domesticviolence,"I have an abusive ex, that won’t leave me alone and his parents say escape and live with them, but he most likely will follow me where I go.",1
2285,domesticviolence,He told me he would.,1
2286,domesticviolence,Should I get a restraining order before I go?,1
2287,domesticviolence,"My ex sent me a video of a switchblade, I asked him why he had that and he said “cutting people up” and then he said “it’s an Italian style switch blade”.. I’m Italian... Anyways, he’s put a loaded gun to my head in the past.",1
2288,domesticviolence,I’m actually pretty terrified of him now.,1
2289,domesticviolence,He also once brought explosives to my brothers house and claimed he “forgot they were there”.. none of my family or our friends growing up believed me when I told them about him.,1
2290,domesticviolence,Which is why I can’t talk to anyone.,1
2291,domesticviolence,"I feel sad for you, I feel sad for me.",1
2292,domesticviolence,"I pray that you will get the help you so desperately need so that nobody else has to endure the terror and horrible horrible physical, sexual, and emotional abuse you have put me through.",1
2293,domesticviolence,I am riding myself of all my shame associated with what has happened.,1
2294,domesticviolence,"I know now, it was all you.",1
2295,domesticviolence,I did not do anything wrong to deserve the horrible treatment I received from you.,1
2296,domesticviolence,It feels as if no one understands what I’m going through in my life because I took a while to leave and didn’t tell anyone until now.,1
2297,domesticviolence,I really didn’t think it was that bad.,1
2298,domesticviolence,"Now that I’m out of the situation, it still haunts me.",1
2299,domesticviolence,I feel guilty and still like it’s all my fault somehow even though it’s irrational and not true.,1
2300,domesticviolence,Does anyone else feel like this?,1
2301,domesticviolence,"For example, she once tried to stab her mum's boyfriend because she didn't want her mum to be with anyone - they were in their mid 60s.",1
2302,domesticviolence,"She has been in a lot of fights over the years, but in general isn't usually physically violent - it's usually manipulation.",1
2303,domesticviolence,I'm concerned because she found out last night that he is seeing this ex gf of his.,1
2304,domesticviolence,"He doesn't know how she found out - he's kept it very, very private.",1
2305,domesticviolence,She came back to the house they used to share (he was there with their kids in bed while she had been out) and lost it with him.,1
2306,domesticviolence,I had bought our son a special outfit themed from the movies just for this occassion.,1
2307,domesticviolence,"Neither of us got much sleep that night, and when I tried to talk to him in the morning about leaving, he got really agitated and raised his voice to me.",1
2308,domesticviolence,Our daughter ran into her room and I found her hiding under her covers.,1
2309,domesticviolence,"After again trying to talk to him, he ended up refusing to go, I'm still not sure why.",1
2310,domesticviolence,"He then ignored me for days again, we again briefly made up for my son's birthday, and started fighting again not long after.",1
2311,domesticviolence,Every time I tell him to leave he threatens to harm my pets or take them and release them to the wild (I have ferrets.... they CANNOT survive in the wild where I live) or he goes into rants about how useless I am and how I couldn't survive without him and somehow he worms his way back in for fear he might be right.,1
2312,domesticviolence,TLDR; need him out.,1
2313,domesticviolence,He threatens animals.,1
2314,domesticviolence,**REALLY** don't wanna involve police.,1
2315,domesticviolence,What do I do?,1
2316,domesticviolence,"Not because I didn’t have evidence, but because none of the evidence was permissible in court.",1
2317,domesticviolence,My last order of protection was denied.,1
2318,domesticviolence,I’m a survivor of childhood incest.,1
2319,domesticviolence,It just seems like no one cares or wants to care about the psychological repercussions any of this abuse has on people.,1
2320,domesticviolence,And I’m the one to blame for not being a perfectly normal person.,1
2321,domesticviolence,When it is his weekend off).,1
2322,domesticviolence,He grumbles and yells only on his 'nervous' days.,1
2323,domesticviolence,Maybe once a week.,1
2324,domesticviolence,Sometimes three days in a row.,1
2325,domesticviolence,Sometimes it is two weeks of not yelling.,1
2326,domesticviolence,Is this what a guy who loves you deserves?,1
2327,domesticviolence,Is this my punishment for life?,1
2328,domesticviolence,Doesn’t some part of you feel something for me?,1
2329,domesticviolence,"I see you and Jane are out tonight so as I sit here alone and dying inside knowing that the most important thing in my life is leaving me and I’ll never even see you again, doesn’t something inside you feel just a morsel of empathy and reciprocal love back for me and to me and want to give me some chance?",1
2330,domesticviolence,Why do I have to be destroyed for this?,1
2331,domesticviolence,And we are almost out of groceries until food stamps come in on the 3rd.,1
2332,domesticviolence,I don't know what to do without him but I'm covered in bruises and in so much pain.,1
2333,domesticviolence,I am worried because my 9 year old watched the whole thing and was so scared she was shaking.,1
2334,domesticviolence,Sorry this is so long.,1
2335,domesticviolence,I guess I just needed to vent.,1
2336,domesticviolence,I beg him to let go of me so I can get my phone and call my dad.,1
2337,domesticviolence,I bang on the floor and scream for help to try to get the downstairs neighbours' attention.,1
2338,domesticviolence,"He mocks my crying and tells me he's not doing anything to me, that I'm freaking out over nothing.",1
2339,domesticviolence,"We're struggling against each other, his elbow hitting my face, his arm occasionally choking me.",1
2340,domesticviolence,"I fight hard to inch towards my phone to get help, but any time I get close he grabs my phone and throw it out of my reach.",1
2341,domesticviolence,""", ""how about reasoning with him on that?",1
2342,domesticviolence,""", ""it's understandable that he is threatened by your new friendships with other women and he handles it by getting angry""...",1
2343,domesticviolence,I am not being critical but I really don't think my therapist knows how to handle what I'm dealing with.,1
2344,domesticviolence,"I said to him yesterday, ""how can I sit down and have a rational conversation with someone i don't feel safe around at times?""",1
2345,domesticviolence,"Have others experienced therapists who weren't helpful, or who coached you to behave in ways that would work with someone who was not abusive, and possibly put you in more danger?",1

2347,domesticviolence,she berates my family (yeah my family is screwed up!,1
2348,domesticviolence,but show me a family that isn't) and will freak out the moment I critiscise hers.,1

2352,domesticviolence,"did you do something wrong?"".",1
2353,domesticviolence,The only thing I got from the police was a worn out looking card to the social work department (and by the way they offer counselling - nothing else).,1

2362,domesticviolence,We have a 12 month old baby boy who is a very loved and cherished child.,1
2363,domesticviolence,"Early on in our relationship there were a couple of events that looking back i should have treated as red flags, basically my partner reacted volcanically to some fairly normal behaviour on my part such as messaging with a female friend (actually wife of one of my old mates) and me trying to arrange to meet my friends from home for beers (i live a couple of cities away from my home town).",1
2364,domesticviolence,I wrote this stuff off as isolated incidents and we eventially bought a place together and decided to start the family we'd both always dreamt of.,1
2365,domesticviolence,The pregnancy was kind of a beautiful bubble of love and anticipation and i was (and still am) elated by the arrival of our little boy.,1
2366,domesticviolence,"I don't want a situation to come where she calls the police lying saying I hit her (anytime a domestic incident happens, it's automatically the guy's fault) She's called the police falsely on my dad twice, so I wouldn't put it passed her.",1

2382,domesticviolence,I feel like I just have to come to terms with how he is and learn to live with it but I'm miserable all the time.,1
2383,domesticviolence,I don't have any friends anymore.,1
2384,domesticviolence,"Eventually I reported the texts, as they kept coming, and I recieved verbal backlash from his friends for doing it (I live in a small community, running into him or his buddies all the time).",1
2385,domesticviolence,"Then, radio silence.",1
2386,domesticviolence,"I felt minor relief every day I didn't hear from him, or his friends.",1
2387,domesticviolence,"After his second appearance in court, he pled not guilty to charges of uttering threats and assault.",1
2388,domesticviolence,I was shocked.,1
2389,domesticviolence,I once went to the hospital and needed hand surgery so I messaged her when I found out and said “hey mom I’m in the hospital I’m having surgery tonight thought I would let you know.” She never came to visit and she never even asked what kind of surgery it was.,1
2390,domesticviolence,What do I do?,1
2391,domesticviolence,I feel like I’m nothing but I burden and I just wanna disappear.,1
2392,domesticviolence,I rebelled and did my own thing as a teenager because I was so hurt from what I had been through is it normal for her to hold it against me?,1
2393,domesticviolence,She just sees me as the fuck up causing her annoyance.,1
2394,domesticviolence,"Since I was fifteen my stepdad, when he returns home from work, drunk.",1
2395,domesticviolence,Always ask me to massage his naked back by stepping on it almost every night.,1
2396,domesticviolence,"Even if it's midnight, he'll make my mom wake me up, even tho I don't want to.",1
2397,domesticviolence,But I'll comply because I was afraid to refuse as he could get quite angry if I do so.,1
2398,domesticviolence,"I don't know what's going on inside my mom's head at that time, but I just assume that she's too powerless, too afraid of my stepdad.",1
2399,domesticviolence,"The man who abused me, his mother is a political figure.",1
2400,domesticviolence,I SUSPECT she is using her wealth and influence to keep her sons abuse secret.,1
2401,domesticviolence,"The family has been blaming me for my abuse, denying it happened, threatenung me into changing my story, and generally defaming my character.",1
2402,domesticviolence,I can't prove it but suspect this may have happened to a girl before me.,1
2403,domesticviolence,Is there a way to expose this family?,1
2404,domesticviolence,"And really, that's why I'm typing this post.",1
2405,domesticviolence,"I want to know for certain if I was witnessing a domestic violence incident (feel free to delete this post if otherwise - again, this is a throwaway, so I don't mind), if there's anything I could and/or should have done differently there, and if there's anything I can do to help in case this happens again (which knowing my job, it will).",1
2406,domesticviolence,"I'm wondering if I should have slipped her info to a hotline, or lied about calling the police, or *something* - in the back of my mind, I keep telling myself there was something I could have done here.",1
2407,domesticviolence,Any ideas?,1
2408,domesticviolence,"EDIT:  In case it isn't clear, I DID call the police - I just didn't inform them of my domestic violence suspicions until they arrived, due to what happened between the call and their arrival.",1
2409,domesticviolence,He’s claiming I beat him in that fight.,1
2410,domesticviolence,I had to go to court and be treated like I was the abuser and the whole time he sat there next to me.,1
2411,domesticviolence,A protection order was written and I nor my daughter can go home.,1
2412,domesticviolence,I have a 30 day to vacate of face eviction from my landlord and I lost my job over all of this.,1
2413,domesticviolence,My pre trial is next month and my lawyer seems like he has no idea about my case.,1
2414,domesticviolence,I feel so damaged by my childhood that I feel like I could never be fixed.,1
2415,domesticviolence,Everything he's said is true about me.,1
2416,domesticviolence,"I am stupid, crazy, cunt, bitch, whore, and people only want me for my body.",1
2417,domesticviolence,I feel so ready to just go.,1
2418,domesticviolence,I hate myself so much.,1
2419,domesticviolence,She hangs up; told me she was going to; but she leaves.,1
2420,domesticviolence,That was a bit frightening.,1
2421,domesticviolence,"But I guess at that stage the police were already here, because the abuse from him starts.",1
2422,domesticviolence,“Oh you actually called the fucking cops did you?” “Why would you call the fucking cops?” “I can’t believe you’d call the fucking cops”.,1
2423,domesticviolence,"Three days later, I’ve just checked the phone.",1
2424,domesticviolence,"Let alone his assault charges from beating her, RIGHT?",1
2425,domesticviolence,"If it did, what would be her options with the issue of the lease she wouldn't be able to afford?",1
2426,domesticviolence,I desperately want to help her with this situation.,1
2427,domesticviolence,"I feel like if I can help her and choose not to, anything that happens to her becomes my fault.",1
2428,domesticviolence,I refuse to let that happen.,1
2429,domesticviolence,My husband has poor impulse control (his words) especially when he gets angry or frustrated.,1
2430,domesticviolence,I've noticed he often will take out frustration on the dog (he's a rescue who is legitimately hard to manage).,1
2431,domesticviolence,"He's never hit me or hit the dog, but he will often pull the leash too hard and go too far with discipline.",1
2432,domesticviolence,"For example the other day, the dog was having a lot of anxiety and being bad and barking in the car at every dog we passed.",1
2433,domesticviolence,When we arrived home my partner got out of the car and pulled the dogs leash so hard that he fell out the door into his back.,1
2434,domesticviolence,"After I took care of healing my self, my biggest concern has been that he will do it again to another poor woman.",1
2435,domesticviolence,"He is already dating someone new that is even younger than I am, I was already 13 years younger than him, and I am so worried for her that once she passes the 2 year dating mark he will repeat the pattern of abuse just as he has done in the past.",1
2436,domesticviolence,I wish there was a way to at least give women and men the chance to know of what they are getting into ahead of time and then let them make the decision if they think the person is reformed or not before getting trapped in a potentially abusive relationship.,1
2437,domesticviolence,It makes me sick that the pattern of abuse can continue without any transparency.,1
2438,domesticviolence,I wish there was an online database of domestic abusers similar to sex offenders.,1
2439,domesticviolence,The problem is that I have zero support system.,1
2440,domesticviolence,I have a job but I couldonly afford this motel room for a week and my dog followed me on foot for a few miles until we somehow got separated.,1
2441,domesticviolence,He ended up at someone else's home and I want him back so badly.,1
2442,domesticviolence,I have no way to go get him and I'm scared and alone and  I'm a Christian but I need someone to tell me it's going to be ok.,1
2443,domesticviolence,Please.,1
2444,domesticviolence,Im so in love with my wife when she’s happy and herself.,1
2445,domesticviolence,We have everything in common.,1
2446,domesticviolence,But when she becomes abusive and manipulative it’s too much and she says she will change and she’s taking meds now and she booked a counselor but I don’t know if this is more manipulation and lies or if it’s real?,1
2447,domesticviolence,I just don’t know.,1
2448,domesticviolence,She’s had soooo many chances to do this but only after we have separated is she ever actually doing anything about it.,1
2449,domesticviolence,Ask a local representative for help?,1
2450,domesticviolence,What are some steps I can take that I haven't yet?,1
2451,domesticviolence,"I'm scared, and so .... almost annoyed of dealing with this, he was served a protective order way back in October 2017.",1
2452,domesticviolence,Also...how has he repeatedly had so much success with the police?,1
2453,domesticviolence,"It honestly baffles me, which is why I wonder whether he's paying them off (he told me he'd done this while we were together, although that could've been a fear tactic).",1
2454,domesticviolence,"I used to always feel I loved him more than he does with me, that was a common fight.",1
2455,domesticviolence,And it turned out to be sickly true.,1
2456,domesticviolence,"I care so much for that man, I place myself in his shoes and feeling the pain he must be feeling being alone.",1
2457,domesticviolence,"I know this is sick of me, but how do I stop this?!",1
2458,domesticviolence,I shouldn’t feel bad for what he did right?,1
2459,domesticviolence,!,1
2460,domesticviolence,I loved that man so much and tried my best to make it work.,1
2461,domesticviolence,But I have limits.,1
2462,domesticviolence,"And when he was not thinking twice about getting alcohol while we didn’t have even enough money left for milk for our baby, that was my limit.",1
2463,domesticviolence,We had .51 cents in our account and he found that acceptable?,1
2464,domesticviolence,!,1
2465,domesticviolence,I find myself curious if any of you have experienced a partner who with holds sex and affection as part of their abuse pattern.,1
2466,domesticviolence,I mostly read about men who force or otherwise guilt/manipulate their partners to have sex.,1
2467,domesticviolence,My situation is different.,1
2468,domesticviolence,My husband refuses to touch me.,1
2469,domesticviolence,"If I try to initiate sex which I have done many times in the past, he will flat out push me away.",1
2470,domesticviolence,I can't even talk about the day she left me because it was so traumatic.,1
2471,domesticviolence,I can't even admit it to myself.,1
2472,domesticviolence,It was awful beyond words and I can't tell anyone.,1
2473,domesticviolence,How can I see a therapist if I'm afraid I'm going to lose my shit just opening up about that one day?,1
2474,domesticviolence,I feel like it would ruin any progress I've made...I'm afraid I'm going to be hiding forever.,1
2475,domesticviolence,"I won't defend myself, I know I shouldn't have raised my voice and I should have left much much earlier.",1
2476,domesticviolence,I know who I am.,1
2477,domesticviolence,"That said.. Every day, I see a look that tells me a person I know loathes me.",1
2478,domesticviolence,A thin veneer of social platitudes to cover a roiling hatred.,1
2479,domesticviolence,I don't know what to write past this point.,1
2480,domesticviolence,I have been trying to find an answer to this question over 6 months.,1
2481,domesticviolence,My story starts when I changed while my life for the man I loved by believing him that he loves me and moving to California from Israel.,1
2482,domesticviolence,Since I was the one who were going to take the big step I had many concerns yet he always literally begged me to move here... finally I did move here and we got married.,1
2483,domesticviolence,After a while I found out from a Facebook message that he has been cheating on me all those time that he was begging me to move in with him.,1
2484,domesticviolence,I asked him about the message and he lied about it over an hour.,1
2485,domesticviolence,"Weird title I know but I really couldn’t find any other way to describe what I’m feeling and I really struggled to think if I should post this on here or another group So for as long as I can remember I’ve always been attracted to women and only women I had absolutely no interest in men at all A few years back I had my first relationship which was really manipulative and physically abusive and I haven’t been on any dates since then Recently though (like in the last two weeks) it’s accused to me that bar an old crush from before my ex “kinda-sorta” coming back I haven’t found any women attractive at all in a while at least a year and whenever I see someone I would have normally found attractive I just get a nervous/uncomfortable feeling I can’t really describe I’m not sure if this is a response to how my ex used to get abusive if she thought I was attracted to her (like she’d insist I must want to rape her if I called her beautiful for example) and I know for a long time afterwards I felt disgusted with myself if I found someone attractive so this may just be the next step in that, like my mind doesn’t want me to feel bad for finding someone attractive so it stops finding people attractive",1
2486,domesticviolence,He goes in the bedroom and we only have one car so he has to take me to work.,1
2487,domesticviolence,He is just sitting on the bed and I have to be at work in literally 16 minutes (I live close to my work).,1
2488,domesticviolence,I said come on you're going to make me late and he said well find the fucking car keys.,1
2489,domesticviolence,So I started looking then he found them.,1
2490,domesticviolence,Then honestly he was just going on and on and yelling at me and I tuned out what he was saying so I don't even remember.,1
2491,domesticviolence,"This past week he's gotten really bad where he told her she couldn't use the house phone, her cell phone, the computer, the car, or even watch tv.",1
2492,domesticviolence,He even stopped eating food that my mom makes and starting making his own for himself.,1
2493,domesticviolence,Yesterday I atleast bought my mom a new cell phone and added her to my plan.,1
2494,domesticviolence,He hasn't improved in the past week whatsoever.,1
2495,domesticviolence,This was the last straw for me and I want to move out in the next 2 months and ask her to live with me temporarily.,1
2496,domesticviolence,I don’t know what to expect.,1
2497,domesticviolence,I just want to not be so alone.,1
2498,domesticviolence,He is a law enforcement officer in this small town.,1
2499,domesticviolence,I’ve been down this road with him before.,1
2500,domesticviolence,The injuries have never been so severe though.,1
2501,domesticviolence,"Dear reddit, For what I am about to tell you today is not a rant from a ""man"", but a voice of a concerned human being who happens to be male.",1
2502,domesticviolence,Victims of domestic violence who are men are being laughed at and not taken seriously in today's society.,1
2503,domesticviolence,"It seems the society has made up their mind that men could not be victims of female violence because the male is ""much bigger"", therefore the male has some kind of ""agenda"" against the female.",1
2504,domesticviolence,I was punched and slapped in the face two weeks ago by my wife who is 5'2 103lbs.,1
2505,domesticviolence,He came after me a few times so I got away and called cops.,1
2506,domesticviolence,"He was arrested, restraining order in place and he also had unregistered gun and no licence for them so he may be in trouble for that also.",1
2507,domesticviolence,"The hard part is he was good to my son, and now he is abruptly gone which is best, but I am not not sure how to explain to him.",1
2508,domesticviolence,he is six and very sensitive and the spent a lot of time together.,1
2509,domesticviolence,"tl;dr boyfriend got aggressive and is jailed, how to tell young son why bf is gone now and we have to move soon?",1
2510,domesticviolence,"So I drank wine and I started crying and since my husband was constantly telling me that I ruined his life and he regrets being married to me and I'm the devil and blah blah, for the first time in my life I picked up the knife and I thought I should just kill my self.",1
2511,domesticviolence,When my husband saw me he started screaming and snatched the knife away from me and said I am trying to get him into trouble by committing suicide.,1
2512,domesticviolence,He kicked me and spat on me.,1
2513,domesticviolence,I kept on try to explain to him that I can't take him blaming me for everything and he believes everything he says so hard that every works out of my mouth is a lie.,1
2514,domesticviolence,I tried telling him I am trying to fix myself.,1
2515,domesticviolence,"Broken bones, concussion.",1
2516,domesticviolence,"He broke my glasses in half, destroyed my TV and dvd player.",1
2517,domesticviolence,He tore my clothes off but luckily didn't rape me.,1
2518,domesticviolence,He did however scare me so much that I twice defecated in his room.,1
2519,domesticviolence,"The kicks to my face came about every 15-20 mins, when he would work himself up while yelling.",1
2520,domesticviolence,She doesn't pay for my tuition yet constantly puts me down by calling me dumb.,1
2521,domesticviolence,Anyone have any tips on how to survive the next week?,1
2522,domesticviolence,So far I've been playing super loud music in my headphones whenever she tries to come up and say something to me but I'm looking for options that are less likely to end up in my going deaf haha.,1
2523,domesticviolence,Any tips for how I can quickly forge a future without her in my life would be helpful too.,1
2524,domesticviolence,I'm in my third year of college and am hoping to have a job after I graduate but at the moment I feel so chained down to her.,1
2525,domesticviolence,"I think it was last year, we could hear the little girl crying out so loud inside their home, we called the cops.",1
2526,domesticviolence,"This is just a rumor, but our next-door neighbors say that the house is actually under police watch, and that they're drug dealers.",1
2527,domesticviolence,"The dad is some heavily obese man who should probably invest in larger shirts, and he doesn't leave the home.",1
2528,domesticviolence,"There are always cars coming and going from the house, sometimes the same cars, other times cars we've never seen before.",1
2529,domesticviolence,"Ya know, to buy drugs and shit.",1
2530,domesticviolence,He shouldn't be able to do that to anyone else.,1
2531,domesticviolence,I'm just so scared.,1
2532,domesticviolence,"I wasn't perfect either and I'm scared people won't believe me, or he will twist it so he's the victim and I'm the bad guy, although I know what happened was wrong and I have evidence that he knows what he did was wrong.",1
2533,domesticviolence,"Im scared this will ruin my life, but I also can't bear the thought of him doing that to anyone else.",1
2534,domesticviolence,If anyone needs details about what happened I can share,1
2535,domesticviolence,"During the walk she made a lot of threats about how she was going to call the police, put me in jail, even try to get me deported (I'm a LPR.)",1
2536,domesticviolence,She gets vindictive like this but usually calms down.,1
2537,domesticviolence,Due to the threats I called the police to ask their advice.,1
2538,domesticviolence,The officer wanted me to give him her information and I declined.,1
2539,domesticviolence,"Short story, he gave me two options.",1
2540,domesticviolence,"Even as I’m cooking, he’s still screaming in my face, telling me that I’m done at my job and I need to quit now.",1
2541,domesticviolence,"I yell back, something about him not having a job and he grips me up from behind with an arm around my throat, and I grab the knife I was using to cut chicken and tell him to get off of me.",1
2542,domesticviolence,"He lets go, and we scream a bit more.",1
2543,domesticviolence,"I made a smart remark, and he jabbed me in my face.",1
2544,domesticviolence,It busted the inside of my lip and I was bleeding.,1
2545,domesticviolence,"We get no child support and are doing well financially without it and although he is supposed to pay, I leave it alone because he leaves us alone.",1
2546,domesticviolence,"Long story short, I didn't file or ask for supervised visitation, but that's what the courts ordered.",1
2547,domesticviolence,He did that two or three times within a year and haven't heard from him since.,1
2548,domesticviolence,This Friday for the first time in years I realized how much my life has changed and how happy I and my children are.,1
2549,domesticviolence,"Then, of course, I get the curve ball of this message on Saturday evening.",1
2550,domesticviolence,"My father is an alcoholic, and he has been for about 34 years.",1
2551,domesticviolence,"My mom has had to deal with this the entire time, and lately, he has been having parties at their house and drinking up until 3-4am almost every weekend.",1
2552,domesticviolence,"He drinks everyday, and my mother usually comes to me to vent about it.",1

2554,domesticviolence,She’s afraid to leave because he says he’ll accuse her of abandoning the home.,1
2555,domesticviolence,I was completely on my own by 14.,1
2556,domesticviolence,When she felt the cuts on my wrists in the dark on night she asked if I was cutting ?,1
2557,domesticviolence,I said no and she never said anything again.,1
2558,domesticviolence,I could go on and on.,1
2559,domesticviolence,I think she truly believes that because I am an adult now that all the screw ups all the pain I have been through is my own fault.,1
2560,domesticviolence,"I endured months and months of all types of abuse, the final time was when he grabbed an iron gym equipment that you attach to the wall and threatened to hit my pregant stomach with it.",1
2561,domesticviolence,"After all of this, after denying my child, saying he wasnt the father, after taking everything he had from me, i missed an important detail: A witness stood quiet.",1
2562,domesticviolence,"To this day, I think heavily of this, and I fear that karma will get them both (heavens forbid) through the child.",1
2563,domesticviolence,Please.,1
2564,domesticviolence,And November.,1

2571,domesticviolence,We're both military members.),1
2572,domesticviolence,A few things have happened since last Saturday.,1
2573,domesticviolence,"Original post here: <url> Quick update: my abusive ex, who put forward his candidacy for local council, was elected Friday by acclamation - meaning no one came forward to challenge him, so no election will be necessary, and he is automatically the winner.",1
2574,domesticviolence,He is flush with victory at the moment.,1
2575,domesticviolence,"I have decided to come forward anyways, about the emotional and sexual abuse that I experienced during the relationship.",1
2576,domesticviolence,"I know I may pay a price, for speaking openly in our small community.",1
2577,domesticviolence,"I’m in Florida, can’t find concrete laws that apartment companies will let me off lease because of abuse.",1
2578,domesticviolence,As in me getting my name off lease and him staying here.,1
2579,domesticviolence,My fiancé is mentally and emotionally abusive.,1
2580,domesticviolence,"We have had some physical altercations, like him pushing me down, poking me hard in the chest, him ripping off his shirt and than hitting me with it.",1
2581,domesticviolence,"He’s also broken a few pairs of glasses, a remote control, smashed the hell out of his iPhone, and threw a chair across the room almost hitting his dog.",1
2582,domesticviolence,So he hasn't really hit me since we got back together but he's cruel in so many other ways.,1
2583,domesticviolence,He will call met fat ass (I'm 5ft8 and 130 pounds) and just had our third child.,1
2584,domesticviolence,He tells me I'm ugly and a dumb b****h and tells me I can't do anything right.,1

2591,domesticviolence,"Last night, he forced me into our son’s room and as I was trying to escape he slapped my wrist in the door.",1
2592,domesticviolence,So now I'm here not knowing what to do.,1
2593,domesticviolence,I don't want to call the cops because I don't want my mom to get in any trouble for her gambling habits.,1
2594,domesticviolence,So I need some advice for what to do incase something like this ever happens again.,1
2595,domesticviolence,**tl;dr**: My mom cuts her boyfriend because he grabbed her by the throat and I don't know what to do.,1
2596,domesticviolence,"**UPDATE**: After this incident with her boyfriend, my mom wants to move out of the house.",1

2599,domesticviolence,Being forced into buying a computer we couldnt afford then had it thrown at me every fight due to credit card he continuously used (kept under 1k) I also was forced to be precise on where i put things especially when cleaning as to not disrupt him.,1
2600,domesticviolence,He hid snacks and 420 from me when I did most of the purchasing.,1
2601,domesticviolence,It's only happened twice and only happens when he drinks.,1
2602,domesticviolence,I love him dearly and want to help/support him.,1
2603,domesticviolence,He cries and says he's sorry and admits that he is aggressive when he drinks.,1
2604,domesticviolence,I'm so heartbroken I don't know what to do?,1
2605,domesticviolence,Is this even considered domestic abuse/violence?,1
2606,domesticviolence,I have been abused mentally and physically by my step-father when being only 7 and it didn't stop until 12 when I moved to Britain and lived there to this day (17 yr now).,1
2607,domesticviolence,Everyday I was told how worthless I was and was getting beat regularly.,1
2608,domesticviolence,However I coped with it.,1
2609,domesticviolence,"At the start when I came to England, I was crying all the time, when I was called stupid, and idiot or was hit by a friend (A kind of a friendly abuse, you know when you just want to annoy your friends).",1
2610,domesticviolence,"Everyone thought I was just a crybaby, not knowing of my past.",1
2611,domesticviolence,I'm not polyamorous at all and he never mentioned being bisexual to me.,1
2612,domesticviolence,I didn't know what to say.,1
2613,domesticviolence,I kinda went into blank smile mode while inside I was getting sick with jealousy.,1
2614,domesticviolence,He never asked if this was okay for him to do this.,1
2615,domesticviolence,So I considered it cheating.,1
2616,domesticviolence,"She wants to do anything she can do to help me, but it's up to the state, not her, to charge me.",1
2617,domesticviolence,"I have, and documented once I got out of jail, a puncture bite on my right hand, a puncture bite on my left inner elbow, deep scratches all over my left arm, The skin on my scrotum was torn (the jail underwear they gave me was soaked at the end of the day) my lip busted open, a chipped tooth, my whole right side of my face red and sore from a dozen punches, and a welt on my left leg from her kicking me.",1
2618,domesticviolence,Now I'm being charged with 4th degree DV and need legal counsel to prove my innocence.,1
2619,domesticviolence,I have no money to hire anyone and am still in shock that I just had to spend 17 hours in jail without given any medical aid in a small cell with 7 other inmates.,1
2620,domesticviolence,I have no criminal record whatsoever until now.,1
2621,domesticviolence,"I know I want to be treated like a human being, and it's very easy for others to say ""YOU NEED TO QUIT YOUR JOB ASAP.",1
2622,domesticviolence,"Stand up for yourself!""",1
2623,domesticviolence,But it's like leaving a bad relationship...so full of uncertainty and tension.,1
2624,domesticviolence,Please help.,1
2625,domesticviolence,I'm clinging onto the last bit of hope I have.,1
2626,domesticviolence,Wtf is wrong with this society?,1
2627,domesticviolence,!,1
2628,domesticviolence,I’m pissed.,1
2629,domesticviolence,I’m angry.,1
2630,domesticviolence,My abuser is a well known coach who has lost his job over our court cases.,1
2631,domesticviolence,I recently got out of a 2+ year abusive relationship and am now going to court against him with domestic violence charges.,1
2632,domesticviolence,"Originally, I was told that I wouldn’t have to testify as there was ample evidence, but now I am being told I must testify about a week from now.",1
2633,domesticviolence,I am terrified to see my abuser in court and I was wondering what I should expect.,1
2634,domesticviolence,Does anyone have any advice for me or can tell me what I should expect at the trial?,1
2635,domesticviolence,Thank you so much.,1
2636,domesticviolence,Tomorrow afternoon my four children and I are leaving my husband.,1
2637,domesticviolence,"After years of emotional neglected, financial control and recently added physical abuse towards my youngest.",1
2638,domesticviolence,I'm scared that even after our planning we will be turned away from the refuge and have to use the little amount savings to rent a cabin.,1
2639,domesticviolence,I'm scared that I'm making the wrong descion.,1
2640,domesticviolence,Even though my 3 older children have developed mental illness over the past year.,1
2641,domesticviolence,I actually do have access to some money where I believe I could pay off at least some of what I owe but I honestly don’t even know where I can get a number for the debts that I owe.,1
2642,domesticviolence,I am afraid to even begin for several reasons.,1
2643,domesticviolence,"1) I am worried I might actually be in legal trouble over this, 2) I am afraid of seeking help from someone who isn’t understanding of my situation and will just be totally horrified about what a mess it is and they will be mean to me.",1
2644,domesticviolence,Are there any counseling resources available to me?,1
2645,domesticviolence,I am NOT looking for a handout I just need help being walked through the steps of what I need to do to resolve this.,1
2646,domesticviolence,Then I started to notice how much of a temper he has.,1
2647,domesticviolence,The first few weeks he was good at hiding it but it started coming out.,1
2648,domesticviolence,He was full of compliments for me but they were pretty generic and he took me on a bunch of dates.,1
2649,domesticviolence,The last few days I was kind of avoiding him and he kind of tried getting controlling.,1
2650,domesticviolence,Yesterday I was going to spend Christmas eve with him and his family and I tried bringing up some major concerns about the way things were going and he flipped out and started screaming and throwing shit.,1
2651,domesticviolence,I lost a child because of this man and i went back for round 2?,1
2652,domesticviolence,Am I nuts?,1
2653,domesticviolence,Why am I so surprised i've come out looking like i've just had 10 round with Tyson?,1
2654,domesticviolence,Advice please - anyone gone through a similar experience?,1
2655,domesticviolence,What did you do?,1
2656,domesticviolence,He has anger issues and he seems like a good guy sometimes (even though i know he's a fucking monster) and i know he's had a bad childhood.,1
2657,domesticviolence,It's even harder because if he does get arrested or something for it my best friend won't have anyone to support her/pay for her tuition or her meals even... her mom doesn't have the money to do that and i think that's why she still stays with them... just so she can support her daughter.,1
2658,domesticviolence,My family would be willing to take her in but we're not doing well w/ money either.,1
2659,domesticviolence,I really want to do something about it but idk what i can do.,1
2660,domesticviolence,He's been horrible to his family since forever.,1
2661,domesticviolence,"I get a text from my brother that was essentially, ""fuck off and die, nobody wants you here anymore.""",1
2662,domesticviolence,"Clearly I need to move out, but the only person I have in my life is my boyfriend, and although we see each other often, we've been long-distance for awhile and it would be a huge adjustment to move almost 100 miles away (although it would be far enough away from them.)",1
2663,domesticviolence,"Although I love him a lot, I don't exactly want the reason that I move in because he's trying to save me.",1
2664,domesticviolence,"I want to move in because I want to start a new life with him, not to run away from the old if that makes sense.",1
2665,domesticviolence,"So, I guess my question is, what do I do?",1
2666,domesticviolence,I’m having a difficult time coping with how my abusive husband is perceived by family and friends.,1
2667,domesticviolence,"He raged at me, then was perfectly calm and collected as we met family for dinner less than five minutes later.",1
2668,domesticviolence,We go to social events and he’s the perfect gentleman.,1
2669,domesticviolence,"He’s kind, caring, funny, charming...",1
2670,domesticviolence,I sit next to him absolutely blank and speechless.,1
2671,domesticviolence,She comes crying to me and formulates a plan to break up.,1
2672,domesticviolence,She talks to Joe about their issues and her will to leave him wilts.,1
2673,domesticviolence,She stays with him.,1
2674,domesticviolence,"Rinse and repeat, except it gets worse over time.",1
2675,domesticviolence,"How can I break the cycle, or help her break the cycle?",1
2676,domesticviolence,If you intervene he will stoop down to the lowest level cursing his sons out with the worst imaginable.,1
2677,domesticviolence,"First the obvious question, is this domestic abuse?",1
2678,domesticviolence,Domestic violence?,1
2679,domesticviolence,Am I imagining this or blowing it out of proportion?,1
2680,domesticviolence,"I'm in Canada, are there any legal avenues we can use to end this?",1
2681,domesticviolence,Another update: I received two messages from random women yesterday.,1
2682,domesticviolence,"It turns out my boyfriend/abuser has been cheating on me, which is not surprising at this point.",1
2683,domesticviolence,"One of them, he went to get us food while I was home with my son, he paid for this woman's family's meal and got her number, and has been asking her out for drinks every couple days.",1
2684,domesticviolence,"She sent me screen shots of their conversations and he said, ""The ring I gave her is simply a gift to the woman carrying my child.",1
2685,domesticviolence,"We have had a rocky relationship and I can not see us as anything more than co-parenting"", then said, ""I don't work well with crazy"".",1
2686,domesticviolence,"She has had wounds on her face once, one doctor saw them, wrote them down, and offered to call the police.",1
2687,domesticviolence,They replied that she'd have to come there by herself and sue her husband.,1
2688,domesticviolence,Which of course did not happen.,1
2689,domesticviolence,"Turns out I get really numb as the only way to not get dragged into this emotional swamp, but is a hell for its own.",1
2690,domesticviolence,Hating every single contact here.,1
2691,domesticviolence,"But I told him that I’m not over it and his response was kinda like “ I feel so guilty, it makes my life hard, I wish you could just forgive me.” So now I feel pressured to forgive him and it’s frustrating because he didn’t give a damn about my feelings when I was 9 and crying my eyes out because I just saw my dad push mom and hit her.",1
2692,domesticviolence,"In fact, I remember him telling me to shut up.",1
2693,domesticviolence,He didn’t give a damn about my brother when he pushed him against a wall to yell at him when he was only in middle school.,1
2694,domesticviolence,And I can’t help but feel like that fueled my brothers heroin addiction that almost killed him and still could cause he recently relapsed.,1
2695,domesticviolence,I’m just so angry and I don’t want to be.,1
2696,domesticviolence,She wont call the cops because her counselor confirmed they would take away her kids (her mother took all but one from her now).,1
2697,domesticviolence,What the hell can i do?,1
2698,domesticviolence,Edit: she said now I can't tell anyone...,1
2699,domesticviolence,"I'd let her hate me if it meant getting her safe, but I have no idea what this could do to the kids.",1
2700,domesticviolence,Very confused.,1
2701,domesticviolence,There are also things he doesn't like.,1
2702,domesticviolence,He doesn't like when my mom go out to go gamble with his money.,1
2703,domesticviolence,"He works his ass off everyday, gives her money to pay bills, and she constantly goes gambling with her friend.",1
2704,domesticviolence,"Yes I do know that my mom is wrong for that, but me and my siblings can't say or do anything as she is our mother.",1
2705,domesticviolence,So they argue about these these things constantly every single day.,1
2706,domesticviolence,I'm scared to start the eviction process but I NEED to protect myself and my son.,1
2707,domesticviolence,"Hell, im even scared to  ask this asshole to take the trash out.",1
2708,domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
2709,domesticviolence,I feel like an empty shell of a person with no strength to get out of this mess.,1
2710,domesticviolence,This is mostly a rant but does anyone have any advice or words of encouragement?,1
2711,domesticviolence,"The worst situations were forcing me to make a statement I knew was untrue (in order to allow me to get ready for work); becoming sexually rough and chasing me into another room to force himself on me, and rages where I’ve felt threatened.",1
2712,domesticviolence,These things have ruined my trust and love for him over time.,1
2713,domesticviolence,The controls and double standards that are in place are extensive.,1
2714,domesticviolence,So why do I still feel conflicted about leaving?,1
2715,domesticviolence,I guess I need an extra push.,1
2716,domesticviolence,"I live in a high end building and I feel if I were to talk to the people who work in the office they wouldn’t take my name off the lease, that they wouldn’t care.",1
2717,domesticviolence,"I have told a couples therapist and my individual therapist the things he has done in the past, and what he says to me and his actions.",1
2718,domesticviolence,I believe they would vouch for me.,1
2719,domesticviolence,"I also think if I were to say to the office people that I would like to leave before a real scene is made (cops being called, screaming, damage, etc) that they will be more inclined to take my name off lease.",1
2720,domesticviolence,Thoughts?,1
2721,domesticviolence,And I hated him too.,1
2722,domesticviolence,I had dreams of him stabbing me in the chest.,1
2723,domesticviolence,"Eventually I went to my mum, essentially I wanted out, him or me, like a stroppy teenager, and I made her tell me what was going on.",1
2724,domesticviolence,"He'd been making death threats, this time, and the last time too.",1
2725,domesticviolence,He'd kill us all because we'd held him back.,1
2726,domesticviolence,Laundry.,1
2727,domesticviolence,Lots of it.,1
2728,domesticviolence,With my ass still against the door I grab the overflowing laundry basket.,1
2729,domesticviolence,Overturn it.,1
2730,domesticviolence,Sit on the fucking thing.,1
2731,domesticviolence,as a result hes put his hands on me.,1
2732,domesticviolence,He keeps saying im crazy not respecting his space where i keep asking for things to be amicable over and over.,1
2733,domesticviolence,he tells me its my fault that everytime hes done anything to me its because i started it.,1
2734,domesticviolence,I honestly dont know if its true.,1
2735,domesticviolence,Because i kept trying to tell him leave me alone.,1
2736,domesticviolence,She thinks instead I should ask if I can read him how it has impacted me since this has happened.,1
2737,domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
2738,domesticviolence,It's coming up so quickly and I'm feeling a twinge of anxiety as it gets closer.,1
2739,domesticviolence,I keep telling myself I did everything I possibly could and that I should do what feels right to me even if it means I may feel like I'm going backwards at times.,1
2740,domesticviolence,I also have to make a decision on if I want a permanent restraining order or a non violent contact order.,1
2741,domesticviolence,I decided to park behind it to see what their business was.,1
2742,domesticviolence,They called 911 on me.,1
2743,domesticviolence,"I saw the copper stoppers coming and decided to pull in to my driveway, unload my kids and go inside while they dealt with the strange people.",1
2744,domesticviolence,"Well, the were there to deal with me!",1
2745,domesticviolence,And one was walking up to question me while the other followed my children into my house!,1
2746,domesticviolence,"The real irony is that had my dad told the truth about the car, he would be home right now plotting his next scheme, but instead he lied and got caught because of his arrogance.",1
2747,domesticviolence,"The problem we face now, is that there is always the chance my dad might sign the documents and they let him out (he'll probably weasel money out of his youngest brother/my uncle to pay the bail), and then we have to contend with the possibility my dad has something else planned to get us, which he probably does because that's his gig and his only goal in life since his big revelation after the pace maker got put in.",1
2748,domesticviolence,"My dad cannot talk to Bart or Dandy because they are witnesses, and he can't have any communication with my mom either.",1
2749,domesticviolence,"Myself and my brothers are contemplating getting a restraining order of some kind, but given how my dad operates, I'm not sure that will actually protect us from any harm.",1
2750,domesticviolence,"I have an appointment with doctor Doorstall this thursday, probably won't get anywhere but I'm sure he is aware of my dad's situation by now, or will be soon.",1
2751,domesticviolence,It was all so quick and I try and recall now what happened and my brain jumbles up the details but he finally realized what he was doing to me and stopped.,1
2752,domesticviolence,I am a small girl with a very thin build at 5'8 and 125 to 130  pounds maximum and he is a big guy at 6'5 and and 265 pounds and I had no chance of getting him to stop.,1
2753,domesticviolence,He started immediately after hysterically crying because I started to hysterically cry and started to feel like I couldn't breath.,1
2754,domesticviolence,He spent most of the night afterhysterically crying telling me he can't live with himself after this and how he would never put his hands on a woman but something in him just snapped but I don't know how to forgive him or let it go.,1
2755,domesticviolence,I'm still so shocked by what happened I have managed to stop crying and calm down but I don't know how to move on from here.,1
2756,domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
2757,domesticviolence,"The police are no help as I'm usually tossed in the squad car and questioned like a fucking criminal because ""why would she lie?"".",1
2758,domesticviolence,I can't keep the 2400 a month in child support up because I can't get a job (I usually make 3000 a month net) and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be homeless in a few days.,1
2759,domesticviolence,All I want is to help my daughter and make sure she's safe and I've run out of ideas.,1
2760,domesticviolence,Anything you kind folks could think of would be greatly appreciated.,1
2761,domesticviolence,He said he'd take me to my mothers house if I just smoked a cigarette with him.,1
2762,domesticviolence,"I did, but he refused to take me still.",1
2763,domesticviolence,"I continued fighting his hold and he kept saying my name in a gentle voice and telling me to calm down, saying that he loved me and didn't know why I was freaking out, and kept saying, ""you know you're not going to win.",1
2764,domesticviolence,"Go ahead, tire yourself out.",1
2765,domesticviolence,"You know you're not going anywhere.""",1
2766,domesticviolence,I’ve been in an abusive relationship for 3 years now.,1
2767,domesticviolence,"My family had stopped talking to me, and live states away when my boyfriend and I got together.",1
2768,domesticviolence,"The first time I noticed abuse was when he wanted to repeatedly have sex till I was sore, and would get angry if I refused.",1
2769,domesticviolence,It was subtle at first but it scared me.,1
2770,domesticviolence,"As time went on I would here everyday how I was too skinny, I need to gain some weight.. it got to the point to where I would ask questions about why I wasn’t good enough and was depressed ... he would throw a speaker in a room along with me and put stuff in front of the door to where I couldn’t get out.",1
2771,domesticviolence,I got connected with the DV shelter in town to connect to my Crime Victim funds so I don't have to worry about therapy co-pays and I'm filled to the brim with anxiety about class tomorrow.,1
2772,domesticviolence,I'm so tired of this.,1
2773,domesticviolence,I hate that he probably witnessed me plunging into a panic attack.,1
2774,domesticviolence,I hate that he saw that side of me.,1
2775,domesticviolence,I don't want to look weak in front of him.,1
2776,domesticviolence,"A emotional turning point for me was at 16, my dog at the time, a Lovable and super friendly Labrador who was about 3 years, decided to wander out the gate and explore when he drove in after work one evening.",1
2777,domesticviolence,It was a freezing cold night i remember.,1
2778,domesticviolence,Ge had tried calling for our Lab to no avail as our lab was exploring down the road.,1
2779,domesticviolence,My father (i hate saying that!),1
2780,domesticviolence,"Started getting very angry, furious even.",1
2781,domesticviolence,He saved me from my family.,1
2782,domesticviolence,I don't want to give up on him because he's never given up on me.,1
2783,domesticviolence,"TL;DR: Boyfriend often has tantrums where he throws objects around the room, but never physically hits me.",1
2784,domesticviolence,Is this abuse?,1
2785,domesticviolence,How do I get help?,1
2786,domesticviolence,I hide my own set of keys.,1
2787,domesticviolence,"She tries to take her keys away from me and I refuse, which turns into a full-blown fight.",1
2788,domesticviolence,"I have marks and bruises all over my arms and back, as well as deep scratches from her fingernails.",1
2789,domesticviolence,"At one point, she had me on the floor, cornered on the steps, repeatedly slamming my head into the wall and shoving a loose key that fell off the keyring into my breast, still trying to get the rest of the car keys out of my hand.",1
2790,domesticviolence,"I'm not saying I didn't retaliate, but I only went to far as to push her away, never hitting her intentionally but more as an act of defense.",1
2791,domesticviolence,He came home from who knows where and he walks in.,1
2792,domesticviolence,I asked him where he had been because i was starting to get worried.,1
2793,domesticviolence,"He was mad, i could see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice.",1
2794,domesticviolence,Next thing i knew he was behind me with his arm around my neck squeezing.,1
2795,domesticviolence,He continued as he threw me on the couch and wrapped his legs around my stomach.,1
2796,domesticviolence,I have no worth or identity or breathe.,1
2797,domesticviolence,He has blamed me for everything.,1
2798,domesticviolence,I guess I am getting an abortion.,1
2799,domesticviolence,"I was upset his friend brought him somewhere that he ran into a girl he loves, and even though it was just a second it really hurt me.",1
2800,domesticviolence,He hides me from his friends and his friends reject me but all he says is I do not like his friends.,1
2801,domesticviolence,He hasn't paid any child support.,1
2802,domesticviolence,He isn't fulfilling the courts orders that would get him a chance to petition for supervised visitation.,1
2803,domesticviolence,It feels like he's completely just disappeared from being a father but I still feel like he's going to come back.,1
2804,domesticviolence,Even writing about it makes it hard to breathe.,1
2805,domesticviolence,Is it silly?,1
2806,domesticviolence,"He ended up grabbing me by the neck with both hands and slamming my head against the wall in the hallway, he threw me the ground I hit the radiator and then he threw a bucket at me that had a toy and DOG SHIT in it (i genuinely don't think he knew there was dog shit in it, he just threw whatever was there...and our dog must have shit in it.)",1
2807,domesticviolence,I didn't pass out this time.,1
2808,domesticviolence,He went upstairs and slammed his door and locked it.,1
2809,domesticviolence,I got right up and ran up the stairs and told him to let me in to get my shit so I can go.,1
2810,domesticviolence,He told me to leave and I started kicking the door and demanding he lets me into get my shit so I can go.,1
2811,domesticviolence,This is my story I feel I should share in the case things every turn bad.,1
2812,domesticviolence,When I was a kid my brother use to practice the choke slam.,1
2813,domesticviolence,At first it was fun but when I grew up it wasn't.,1
2814,domesticviolence,My brother continue to abuse me for years .,1
2815,domesticviolence,He called me names and some days I believe him.,1
2816,domesticviolence,I used my forearm to push the plate I was eating from off the counter.,1
2817,domesticviolence,A glass bowl fell to the floor as well and shattered.,1
2818,domesticviolence,"The noise woke my dad up, who went to bed nearly black out drunk a couple hours before this.",1
2819,domesticviolence,He immediately started screaming at my friends to “get the fuck out” and aggressively pushing them out of the back door.,1
2820,domesticviolence,He then grabbed me by my arm and shoved me out the door yelling “take her fucking ass with you.” My friends sat with me for a minute and asked if I wanted to leave with them.,1
2821,domesticviolence,Nobody should ever have to put up with that and have to live in fear of someone who can fly off the handle like that.,1
2822,domesticviolence,I wish so badly I knew who she was so that I could tell her in quiet that if she ever needs a place to escape that my door is always open.,1
2823,domesticviolence,Sorry for my rambling.,1
2824,domesticviolence,I'm just not sure what to do or how to approach this.,1
2825,domesticviolence,Any help would be greatly appreciated.,1
2826,domesticviolence,I’ve received hundreds of harassing contacts from him and he’s even tried to extort my friendship back by threatening to expose sex tapes.,1
2827,domesticviolence,I’ve already endured years of his psychological abuse and him physically raping me in the ass while we were together.,1
2828,domesticviolence,I’ve already endured seeing him and the fact that he brings another man that raped me (and he knows it) to every hearing so far.,1
2829,domesticviolence,I’ve endured him harassing our old mutual workplace and every individual mutual contact we had when it first fell apart.,1
2830,domesticviolence,I’ve had him flip friends on me and had to move twice in the past to years to hide my location from him.,1
2831,domesticviolence,I (30F) married my husband (31M) about 6 months ago after dating for 2 years and knowing each other for about 14.,1
2832,domesticviolence,"When we first hooked up, I had a very successful career in the adult industry and I supported him for almost 2 years before he got a job.",1
2833,domesticviolence,He knew what I did before we hooked up because I had been in the industry for years and everyone back home knew.,1
2834,domesticviolence,He told me multiple times that he accepted it and he loved me regardless.,1
2835,domesticviolence,"However, He has been very abusive, always blaming it on my job before and now that I have retired since our marriage he uses my past against me during every fight.",1
2836,domesticviolence,"I’m trying to tell myself it’s like being beat up on the street by a stranger - it’s only once, but it still happened and it’s traumatic.",1
2837,domesticviolence,2) Related to the above.,1
2838,domesticviolence,It WASN’T a stranger.,1
2839,domesticviolence,It was someone I loved and trusted and I can’t believe he could have done this.,1
2840,domesticviolence,"He never treated me right, not truly (except maybe in the very beginning), but I never even saw this as a possibility.",1
2841,domesticviolence,He forced me into sex again... And if I refused he became violent.,1
2842,domesticviolence,"Once I had mentioned to a friend how I hadn't wanted sex and hoped that jacking off would be good enough, and having overheard this my punishment was to be slammed into the wall and the table then thrown to the floor.",1
2843,domesticviolence,"When I pushed him back, telling him to quit, he kicked me down to the ground and heel kicked my back until I had a panic attack and collapsed unable to breathe...",1
2844,domesticviolence,"I spent most nights waiting for him to pass out, which he never did, and running through our small mini-winnie as he chased me with a knife... My dog would come out from under the table (she was a rescue who had been abused) and would trip him up, letting me escape, and he'd hold her hostage-- letting me spend most of the night in the cold, out in the boondocks where it was common for truckers to come through and cougars to attack farm animals and pets.",1
2845,domesticviolence,"If he felt sober enough, he would chase me down the road for a few hundred yards, and I would walk the three miles into town and wait in the park by the police station until I was sure he'd passed out...",1
2846,domesticviolence,Why am I feeling like I miss him.. I’ve been okay for 7 damn days & then he texted my grandmother & asked me if I wanted him to mail me my stuff (a card) & now I’m starting to feel bad.,1
2847,domesticviolence,Why is he seeming so decent now... Why do I feel so damn guilty.. why do I feel like I did something wrong.,1
2848,domesticviolence,"He hasn’t tried to do anything harmful to me, the only thing he’s been asking about is our children as expected..",1
2849,domesticviolence,But I’ve been ignoring him.,1
2850,domesticviolence,Why do I feel like I’m in the wrong.,1
2851,domesticviolence,She gave me an 11 pm curfew even though I was in my 20s and never gave me a key.,1
2852,domesticviolence,She not picked every little thing I did even though I tried so hard to be a good guest because I thought maybe that’s why She didn’t like me.,1
2853,domesticviolence,Whenever I am allowed to come here I have to bring my own food and own blanket.,1
2854,domesticviolence,When I told my mom I was in such a bad mental space that I thought I was going to kill myself and didn’t feel safe to be alone she said I couldn’t come over.,1
2855,domesticviolence,"then i check a side email account that i almost never use, i think i forgot a password or something, and see all these emails from him.",1
2856,domesticviolence,he had been sending me them since essentially the day after i stopped speaking to him.,1
2857,domesticviolence,"saying all this 'i miss you' type stuff, telling me he had something important to tell me.",1
2858,domesticviolence,so i caved.,1
2859,domesticviolence,and it's been downhill ever since then.,1
2860,domesticviolence,"We had an argument, then he started trying to break my phone by bending it.",1
2861,domesticviolence,I intervened and begged him not to and he stopped short of breaking it.,1

2866,domesticviolence,"I’m in horrible physical pain, emotionally heartbroken and being ignored by my kids until I turn them back over to him tomorrow.",1
2867,domesticviolence,I don’t even know why I am posting.,1
2868,domesticviolence,I don’t know what to expect.,1
2869,domesticviolence,I just want to not be so alone.,1
2870,domesticviolence,"I can't be in an abusive relationship, but I find my brain trying to rationalize this.",1

2872,domesticviolence,"I've been stuck in a depressive episode for the greater part of a year, despite medication changes and weekly therapy sessions.",1
2873,domesticviolence,"I've been suicidal for quite some time now and he knows that, but last week he actually told me ""maybe you should just kill yourself.""",1
2874,domesticviolence,"So, in light of that happening very recently, I'm in a very dark place right now.",1
2875,domesticviolence,"he could not understand why i resented him, when in his mind, it was ME who was being 'abusive'.",1
2876,domesticviolence,"because i couldnt fake being into sex with him, which made me a 'bad girlfriend', because i wasn't ecstatic about always having to take on every responsibility and basically take care of him as if he were a child.",1
2877,domesticviolence,"he constantly told me that i was just playing the victim, when it reality it was really him who actually was the victim.",1

2883,domesticviolence,The level of anxiety is near panic attack and occasionally leads to one to the point where I dont eat and barely sleep for days.,1
2884,domesticviolence,TL;DR: feeling guilty over nothing from being conditioned in a previously abusive relationship.,1
2885,domesticviolence,I want him to die because then we'll be truly safe.,1
2886,domesticviolence,But I don't want him to suffer.,1
2887,domesticviolence,There have been times when I did.,1
2888,domesticviolence,And I denied that there was ever any love because that was easier than accepting that a man who once loved his family decided he hated them so much he wanted to kill them.,1

2890,domesticviolence,"He has made me eat until I literally threw up, then forced me to eat my vomit.",1

2919,domesticviolence,"I ask him to do the kitchen, which sometimes takes days for him to get to.",1
2920,domesticviolence,"Hi, My partner is a Dv survivor after 15 years, he eroded everything about her and mentally abused her mostly throughout with sexual elements towards the last few years Shes lovely, the most caring girl in the world and so beautiful But its also not easy, she likes a few drinks at weekends and the drink brings out a different girl or maybe its the true girl im not sure, this girl has vivid flashbacks and they are pretty harsh Shes in therapy too and thats tough going as well its popping the cork on all the anger she has bottled up over 15 years",1
2921,domesticviolence,I don’t know how to make him leave because he says if I do that he will go and dispute all the charges I ever made on his debit card and say it was fraud and he will have me prosecuted.,1
2922,domesticviolence,"In the past when we were together I stupidly sent him private photos of myself and he threatens to send them to my church, my parents, and my bosses.",1
2923,domesticviolence,"He says he will do whatever he can to ruin my life and see that I lose my job and lose the respect of everyone in my life and have legal consequences go using his money (which again, he said I could but now he’s saying I’m lying).",1
2924,domesticviolence,I feel like he literally dictates my life.,1
2925,domesticviolence,He breaks things in my apartment.,1
2926,domesticviolence,I close the door and put my back against it.,1

2930,domesticviolence,"He finally tells me that I can, and that he can't wait for me to be gone.",1
2931,domesticviolence,Why is this the hardest month?,1
2932,domesticviolence,"Is it that the nerves have cleared, minute by minute anxiety calmed, hopelessness resolved, and now I have to sit a grieve a person I made up in my head?",1

2957,domesticviolence,I feel trapped and I think it’s making me like I’m acting like a child these days.,1
2958,domesticviolence,At least from my perspective.,1
2959,domesticviolence,He drained my accounts and I’m financially dependent because I fear not paying bills and I have to feed my daughter and myself.,1
2960,domesticviolence,In laws say they can help us...but they’re still his parents.,1
2961,domesticviolence,Something like that happened again.,1
2962,domesticviolence,"He was angry with me and wanted me to go to another room so he didn't have to look at me but I wanted to stay (not getting involved in any conflict or anything, just doing my studying and not interacting) so he took me out of the room by force, not hard again, but I got hysterical nonetheless.",1
2963,domesticviolence,"After calming down I continued my studies in the kitchen, trying not to think of what had happened and where this relationship was going.",1
2964,domesticviolence,In about an hour he came to me and it looked like his anger was unresolved as he was provoking me.,1
2965,domesticviolence,I decided not to get involved because this time I was genuinely frightened of what was going on.,1
2966,domesticviolence,He loves them and treats them like gold.,1
2967,domesticviolence,I love the type of father he is but I hate the way he treats me.,1
2968,domesticviolence,I have no one to open up to or go to if I even tried to leave him.,1
2969,domesticviolence,I’m tired of him abusing me mentally and physically me.,1
2970,domesticviolence,He has cheated on me several times and each time it knocks my self esteem Lower and lower.,1
2971,domesticviolence,I thought I did well but I was severely depressed.,1
2972,domesticviolence,That weekend was my birthday weekend and he made it miserable.,1
2973,domesticviolence,He said I was a brat to ever think that it was a special day.,1
2974,domesticviolence,I received the silent treatment from him and him being drunk and telling me that i'm worthless and don't do anything for him.,1

2984,domesticviolence,The abuse continue on for 4 years.,1
2985,domesticviolence,There was peaceful time I thought the abuse stopped.,1

2989,domesticviolence,How do we deal with this?,1
2990,domesticviolence,I just posted my whole story <url> but it's literally too long for anyone to actually read.,1
2991,domesticviolence,I mainly want to know if this would be considered rape: MOST RECENT ABUSE: I worked 7 days in a row and finally had one night off on a Friday.,1
2992,domesticviolence,"I expressed I wanted to spend it with him, but since I went out the night before he was determined to go out with his friends that night.",1
2993,domesticviolence,I guess that also comes with ignoring me all night.,1
2994,domesticviolence,"Not being able to let go of the fact that I let this go on for so long, and even the fact that in my heart I still care and want him.",1
2995,domesticviolence,"In my mind I think ""if only"" or ""what if"" but I know those are facades.",1
2996,domesticviolence,"I know he will never be real, open or honest about who he is or what he did.",1
2997,domesticviolence,"I have to forgive myself for letting this take over my life, my heart, my emotions.",1
2998,domesticviolence,I have to forgive myself for not listening to my gut and my intuition.,1

3000,domesticviolence,"I feel totally violated, put down, and blamed for requesting an extension on an order of protection.",1
3001,domesticviolence,Which was denied because he is living in another state.,1
3002,domesticviolence,"Even though, he was unable to show, as he’s out on bond for assaulting a new woman.",1
3003,domesticviolence,"Judge told me, if he harasses you and violates you again, then you can go back through the process to get an order.",1
3004,domesticviolence,He certainly had/has the ability to.,1
3005,domesticviolence,"The worst/best part of this story is that I am still with this prick, trying to get away safely.",1
3006,domesticviolence,Best part is that my story may be horrifying enough to convince women in an early stage DV situation to run before it escalates to my story.,1
3007,domesticviolence,"After the 2nd severe incident, I called family who took me to the ER.",1
3008,domesticviolence,Had lots of tests done.,1
3009,domesticviolence,"No Idea why I am here, guess I just need to vent.",1
3010,domesticviolence,"Well my troubles started last weekend, my parents flew over from Malta to visit my brother whose in hospital.",1
3011,domesticviolence,He is in bad shape and initially he lost the use of his legs few years ago and now his paralysis is rising up to his waste.,1

3030,domesticviolence,I didnt know what to say or what I could do to help.,1
3031,domesticviolence,Everyone I've talked with as told me I should've gotten her phone number because looking her phone number up through our receipts and membership files is an invasion of privacy.,1
3032,domesticviolence,Did I miss my only opportunity to help her by not asking for her phone number?,1
3033,domesticviolence,"Sorry for the sad story, I just don't know what to do and it's painful to think what is happening to her right now.",1
3034,domesticviolence,"Years ago on this day, you did things to me I will not say.",1
3035,domesticviolence,"Although I might have lost a fight, nothing about that at all was right.",1

3043,domesticviolence,That was a couple days ago and i am finding out how close i really came to dying.,1
3044,domesticviolence,He's been violent pretty much since 6months in.,1
3045,domesticviolence,Nothing too horrendous at first just a slap or a punch or he'd spit in my face during an argument or grab me.,1
3046,domesticviolence,I reasoned I could deal with that because he was always so remorseful and depressed afterwards.,1
3047,domesticviolence,"A year in we split up because he stole my car keys out of the ignition, got in the car and threatened to kill me rip out my hair and nails etc.",1

3059,domesticviolence,"It’s subconscious for sure, but just a feeling I get.",1
3060,domesticviolence,"I’m terrified of him, and praying that he gets the real help he needs at the same time.",1
3061,domesticviolence,And I just don’t know how to sort that out.,1

3077,anxiety,It cleared up and I was okay but.,1
3078,anxiety,On Monday I was thinking about humans and how the brain works and it tripped me out I got worried that because I was thinking about how the brain works that I would lose sleep and I did.,1
3079,anxiety,That night was bad just like last time.,1
3080,anxiety,Also yesterday my sleep was bad I woke up like every hour of the night just like last time.,1

3083,anxiety,"The flights won’t be very long (just MSY to LAS then LAX to MSY on the way home), but flying really triggers my anxiety.",1
3084,anxiety,"Mostly I just like having control over myself and my surroundings, so the idea of being in a metal tube 30,000 feet in the air is not ideal for me.",1
3085,anxiety,I also have a lot of fears about terrorist attacks/mass shootings (movie theaters and other crowded public places are also a problem for me).,1
3086,anxiety,I was wondering if anyone has any tips for flying anxiety/fear.,1
3087,anxiety,Everything sets me off and I'm almost having a panic attack.,1
3088,anxiety,I'm going to my dads soon and that also makes me anxious because I'm afraid that I'm not in the mental state to go there and I want to stay at my moms but he really isn't happy when I do that.,1
3089,anxiety,Anyway when she complains or is feeling bad I comfort her and I've never raised my voice at her even when frustrated.,1
3090,anxiety,"When she thinks I disagree with her she raises her voice, I have to talk about what she wants to in general right now because she gets impatient easily.",1
3091,anxiety,I feel like vomiting because she also has so many redeeming factors but I don't want to lose her as a friend.,1
3092,anxiety,"I’ve been taking 12.5 mgs zoloft for about 6 months (yeah, super small dose .. but it was taking the edge off, i think).",1
3093,anxiety,I decided to stop taking it for a few days to see if it was really helping.,1
3094,anxiety,"Now, about 40 hours since my last dose, I’m suddenly kind of shaky and also flushed (my cheeks are burning for no reason.",1
3095,anxiety,And THOSE side effects are about to freak me out - do you think it is from my missed dose?,1

3117,anxiety,And it makes me more anxious which causes me to slip up *more*.,1
3118,anxiety,It's getting WORSE though.,1
3119,anxiety,"I thought I could hold it down, this has been an ongoing issue for about a year or so and it has never been this bad but lately it's getting to the point where I can't even talk to my own MOTHER without freaking out over this shit.",1
3120,anxiety,She came back in town from a very long half year vacation recently and I had to go to dinner with her because that's what you're obligated to do and I had to sit there and try and make small talk with my brother the whole damn night looking anxious as fuck...,1
3121,anxiety,I know they noticed.,1
3122,anxiety,"I didn't do anything during spring break, except maybe go to work.",1
3123,anxiety,"And even then, I missed a day because I just couldn't deal with the stress.",1
3124,anxiety,Most adults get excited to tell you they did absolutely nothing during their break.,1
3125,anxiety,And there was a time when I enjoyed taking a break too.,1
3126,anxiety,"But now it seems like every time I have a break or a day off from work, it makes the stress worse.",1
3127,anxiety,I'm worried I have a blood clot or something that gets aggravated when I wear them.,1
3128,anxiety,"I just want to be okay and to have a good time on this trip, but I've been so out of it, and I'm at my wit's end.",1
3129,anxiety,"Right now I'm lying down and I feel blood rushing all through my head, and bulging of blood vessels around my nose.",1
3130,anxiety,I'm extremely sleep deprived and woozy but I'm scared to go to sleep and am in pain.,1
3131,anxiety,I'm so scared.,1
3132,anxiety,"I know every time I have panic attacks to remind myself it's just in my head, but it sucks when little things just make you feel like shit!",1
3133,anxiety,Does anyone else get triggered by stupid things like this?,1
3134,anxiety,"I'm even just pissed at myself for now feeling mad at my mom, like don't you know not to tell someone with health anxiety that ""they don't look right""??",1
3135,anxiety,Ugh!,1
3136,anxiety,"In class, im always on edge, i cant focus on one thing for too long and i constantly scan my environment and I think they think im looking at them which im not.",1
3137,anxiety,this also made it more awkward to talk to them.,1
3138,anxiety,I been there for a month but im still very nervous around my peers and teachers.,1
3139,anxiety,"I know my teacher and the tutor there get nervous/uncomfortable around me, lately they haven't been talking to me much or coming up to me especially the tutor to ask if I need help  which they did before, my anxiety has gotten worse and I probably look more visibly uncomfortable than ever so that why they have barely asked if I needed help or said much to me ha!",1
3140,anxiety,yet  seem more at ease with other people.,1
3141,anxiety,I was consuming quite a lot of caffeine (up to 500mg per day) during the summer and I'm medicated with 18mg methylphenidate for ADHD.,1
3142,anxiety,"(I was rarely taking caffeine with methylphenidate together as there are a lot of side effects after doing that, one of them is anxiety and increased heart rate).",1
3143,anxiety,I don't take methylphenidate now because of the high bp and my chest pains.,1
3144,anxiety,I have an appointment to the cardiologyst but until then I'll have all my trial exams.,1
3145,anxiety,"I'm only 18 years old, is it really possible to have a chest angina at this age?",1
3146,anxiety,Hello guys.,1
3147,anxiety,This is my first post here.,1
3148,anxiety,"Ever since I can't fall asleep on a random night (few months ago) , I started getting anxiety at night and before heading to bed but everyday is different.",1
3149,anxiety,"Usually, when I get on bed n off the lights, my body started to heat up and i would sweat a little which makes me really uncomfortable.",1
3150,anxiety,My heart would pound fast to which makes me anxious.,1
3151,anxiety,I've never spoken to anyone about my anxiety but I'm pretty sure I have generalized anxiety disorder.,1
3152,anxiety,When I was young I used to be very bright and would take charge of projects and doing assignments.,1
3153,anxiety,As time went on I became lazier but still fairly on top of things.,1
3154,anxiety,When I went into college I suffered and things never clicked.,1
3155,anxiety,Doing even the most simple of tasks or assignments were just so difficult for me.,1
3156,anxiety,I get anxious because I am worried about bad things that I think may happen in my life.,1
3157,anxiety,"Im worried about losing my job, my girlfriend might leave me for someone more funny, with a better job, that is more self confident etc.",1
3158,anxiety,You think these things because you perceive yourself to have no value.,1
3159,anxiety,"I get so preoccupied with these worries and it constantly undermines my self esteem that it applies to other areas in your life, even everyday interactions, going to the store, these can be extremely stressful events.",1
3160,anxiety,You're so unconfident in yourself that you have a million thoughts a second and constantly second guess yourself.,1
3161,anxiety,There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who wanna get to the point this gets kinda lengthy.,1
3162,anxiety,"Hi, I'm 19 and this is my first time posting here and I'm hoping at least one person can relate.",1
3163,anxiety,"Before a few months ago I never had to deal with anxiety really, but out of nowhere it hit me like a truck.",1
3164,anxiety,"I guess what's been causing it is relationship issues, but mostly health anxiety.",1
3165,anxiety,"My first major mistake was googling symptoms I started having, not realizing that it was normal for anxiety to cause physical symptoms.",1
3166,anxiety,"I've tried getting new glasses, but that didn't help.",1
3167,anxiety,Blood work came back fine.,1
3168,anxiety,I have tried medication but only helped with anxiety not focusing issue.,1
3169,anxiety,Some days I just straight out can't focus.,1
3170,anxiety,"Luckily, when I'm on auto-pilot and distracted, I can get a lot done.",1
3171,anxiety,Im 13 years old and except for school i never go outside i usually spend the whole day on the computer just watching videos on youtube and stuff but at the end of the day i get depressed and feel like i'm wasting my life.,1
3172,anxiety,I have friends but i also have severe social anxiety and i always feel as if my friends are just putting up with me.,1
3173,anxiety,I feel depressed and lonely.,1
3174,anxiety,I never spend time with friends and when i do i feel as if they don't want to hang out with me as we never do anything pls reply if i'm not alone,1
3175,anxiety,My chest has a different feeling.,1
3176,anxiety,Before it would feel on fire and chaotic.,1
3177,anxiety,Now it feels just wrong.,1
3178,anxiety,Like I am in medical danger.,1
3179,anxiety,I am a 26 year old woman.,1
3180,anxiety,"Like the title says, I’m rapidly losing motivation.",1
3181,anxiety,"I recently switched collages to be closer to home, so I could be closer to family.",1
3182,anxiety,"And my depressive spirals are coming more often, mainly because of the lack of work I do.",1
3183,anxiety,I always end up doing things at the last damn minute.,1
3184,anxiety,"My freshman year I tried my best, almost.",1
3185,anxiety,Now I know everyone is going to maybe think it's from the suboxone but it or at least used to be one of the things that helped my anxiety.,1
3186,anxiety,If I admitted myself I am afraid they'd admit me and make me go cold turkey.,1
3187,anxiety,I am unemployed and looking for employment.,1
3188,anxiety,I live with my grandparents.,1
3189,anxiety,I'm a 28 year old male.,1
3190,anxiety,I have had the worst anxiety of my life recently.,1
3191,anxiety,"As a college student I am now falling behind in classes, forgetting about sorority events and not interacting with my friends.",1
3192,anxiety,I am slowly losing my mind.,1
3193,anxiety,My room is a mess and the only thing keeping me out of a mental hospital right now is literally my students where I student teach.,1
3194,anxiety,"I am exhausted of fighting to get out of bed everyday, shaking when I sit in class and just not talking to anyone.",1
3195,anxiety,Hi everyone I have GAD that gets much stronger/prevalent when I don't have enough sleep.,1
3196,anxiety,"Coincidentally, it also makes me unable to sleep sometimes, so kinda like a vicious circle.",1
3197,anxiety,"Normally, I don't really have that many problems with it but I just started a new fulltime job with a lot of responsibility and that triggered my insomnia and subsequently all the underlying fears.",1
3198,anxiety,My doctor prescribed Xanax as a when-needed last resort but since I was really scared of withdrawal/addiction after reading up on the drug (it's not called Xanax here but alprazolam) I only started taking 0.5mg at night after really breaking down.,1
3199,anxiety,I am so sleepy and want to sleep so bad but the second I lay down it gets worse.,1
3200,anxiety,My chest and stomach actually tighten up with anxiety and *all* I can do is think about Pippa.,1
3201,anxiety,"Now, what I did was irresponsible and I *should* feel bad about it.",1
3202,anxiety,But this level of anxiety about something that happened 6-7 years ago that I can't do anything about now is insane.,1
3203,anxiety,"I tried talking to my family about it, but they even disagree on the basic premise that Pippa was even neglected.",1
3204,anxiety,"It’s only happened 3/4 times recently but I’ve been putting off having sex and I’m constantly worried that my girlfriend doesn’t think I’m into her or that I’m losing interest, and so on.",1
3205,anxiety,I’ve only just mentioned to her that I might be struggling with some form of anxiety.,1
3206,anxiety,It’s a vicious circle at the moment.,1
3207,anxiety,It’s almost as if I can’t relax and if I have nothing to worry about I create something to worry about.,1
3208,anxiety,Worse than that develop the same anxiety disorder.,1
3209,anxiety,Again another reason to finish the relationship.,1
3210,anxiety,I really love her but cannot and WILL NOT embarrass her like I did at the wedding.,1
3211,anxiety,My plan is to go talk to a private physiatrist and see what they think.,1
3212,anxiety,"I don’t believe medication is the only answer but if it helps in conjunction with therapy, a healthy lifestyle and meditation then I will try it.",1
3213,anxiety,I've always connected my self worth with how well I do in school.,1
3214,anxiety,"Right now, I'm failing the last class I need to graduate.",1
3215,anxiety,The final exam is 2 semester worth of stuff that I never really understood.,1
3216,anxiety,This is my last chance to graduate.,1
3217,anxiety,If I don't pass I wont get into the grad school that conditionally accepted me.,1
3218,anxiety,"I am currently only using 5-htp once a week, i get no benefit when i use it daily.",1
3219,anxiety,I have also been working out which has inevitably eased my depression and made my anxiety more tolerable but its still obviously taking hold of my life.,1
3220,anxiety,"Well here i am at this present moment, I have been contemplating having a sit down with my parents and telling them about my depression (pretty sure they already know, they just don't want to adress it).",1
3221,anxiety,"It had been hard, my parents come home at 9:00 PM and don't want to be bothered with me.",1
3222,anxiety,they go straight to their rooms and the only time they are willing to talk is when they tell me to clean.,1
3223,anxiety,But recently I went on a car journey with my friends and 5 minutes before we got to the destination I started panicking because I thought I needed a wee and took a valium (completely embarrassed myself in-front of my friends).,1
3224,anxiety,once we got to the destination I was actually fine and didn't really need one that bad.,1
3225,anxiety,"Since then it keeps happening, like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking.",1
3226,anxiety,then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear.,1
3227,anxiety,I'm so annoyed at myself that this is starting to control my life.,1
3228,anxiety,I don't know who I'm meant to talk to but I can't breathe.,1
3229,anxiety,I can barely get out of bed or check my phone without panicking.,1
3230,anxiety,But I'm always checking my phone in case someone messages me.,1
3231,anxiety,I don't have it on loud because I don't like the noise.,1
3232,anxiety,"Yet my job requires me to always be reachable and the staff under me always ask me to help them, but I can't even help myself.",1
3233,anxiety,My problems started after my first panic attack which had happened in October.,1
3234,anxiety,"After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects.",1
3235,anxiety,"My bp with Zoloft was around 120/70 After some weeks the anxiety came back with horror, fear of the death and lump in a neck, stiffness in chest.",1
3236,anxiety,"My blood thyroid hormones were measured, everything's perfect.",1
3237,anxiety,I was freaking out.,1
3238,anxiety,"I stood on my back porch for about 30 minutes hyperventilating before I could convince myself that ""I am in control!""",1
3239,anxiety,I was embarrassing !,1
3240,anxiety,I couldn't believe that I allowed myself to get so worked up.,1
3241,anxiety,But it was not as embarrassing as It/ I would soon be.....,1
3242,anxiety,When I was living with people I would stand behind the door and wait for it to be quiet before I step out of my room.,1
3243,anxiety,It makes me so anxious to have to talk to people.,1
3244,anxiety,It didn’t help that one of them would play loud music all day so I would put in my headphones and go to sleep until he has stopped.,1
3245,anxiety,"I was so anxious and depressed that semester, it really affected my grades.",1
3246,anxiety,"Anyway, today was my first time seeing someone for help about my anxiety and I did not know what to expect at all.",1
3247,anxiety,"I'm afraid about what they may do next, what they might say to me next, what they might ask me next.",1
3248,anxiety,"I just want to be by myself, in my own place, with my computer, my keyboard, my guitar, and my bed.",1
3249,anxiety,"I'm a teen, so I don't really have that choice, but to be honest, nobody really does, no matter  how old they are.",1
3250,anxiety,You always have to be around people for one reason or another.,1
3251,anxiety,I'm just never comfortable around people anymore.,1
3252,anxiety,"For no reason, I'll just wake up with anxiety like feelings.",1
3253,anxiety,"Stomach ache, uneasiness, some sort of dread, or feeling like any little thing would bring me over the edge and have a panic attack.",1
3254,anxiety,I don't understand why and it can last for a long time.,1
3255,anxiety,"Sometimes the breathing exercises help take the edge off it, but it doesn't fully help.",1
3256,anxiety,I keep on getting crap from non work people about oh just fly.,1
3257,anxiety,I try to psyche myself up to do it but after the 5 minutes of feeling like “yeah I can do it” I feel beyond tense.,1
3258,anxiety,Anyone been in a similar spot?,1
3259,anxiety,What did you end up doing?,1
3260,anxiety,I’ve put my family through it too many times and it’s putting a strain on my relationship.,1
3261,anxiety,I’m not who I used to be.,1
3262,anxiety,And because of that I’m afraid people are going to leave me.,1
3263,anxiety,My partner especially.,1
3264,anxiety,He’s seen me go through this before and I’m afraid he’s going to give up on me.,1
3265,anxiety,Cut to yesterday... My parents booked me in for an emergency appointment with the DR because my anxiety and depression is so bad I cannot function day to day and spend most of my time stuck in bed panicking.,1
3266,anxiety,I was prescribed 2mg Valium to go alongside my anti-depressants.,1
3267,anxiety,I took one and within 15 minutes I went from SEVERE anxiety to COMPLETE calmness Well... here comes the paranoia associated with my bad cannabis trip years ago...,1
3268,anxiety,I FREAKED.,1
3269,anxiety,Bottom line is this is the first situation in a long while causing me to really get anxious.,1
3270,anxiety,I'm thinking about it most of the time and waffling about it.,1
3271,anxiety,And today I got the invitation and started looking into flights and transport and I'm overwhelmed.,1
3272,anxiety,"I'm at an age where traveling alone shouldn't be a big deal, but it is, I never have traveled alone aside from a handful of 2 hr bus trips in 2007ish.",1

3274,anxiety,I can't stop the ruminating thoughts about the whole process.,1
3275,anxiety,I also can't stop the what if's or I should have done more.,1
3276,anxiety,I keep blaming myself and beating myself up.,1
3277,anxiety,It sometimes makes me physically sick.,1
3278,anxiety,Do you have any tips to help alleviate the pain and stop the thoughts?,1

3285,anxiety,"I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist.",1
3286,anxiety,He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed.,1
3287,anxiety,"I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day.",1

3292,anxiety,"I've been checked out many times, full blood work and other tests and everything perfect with my health as far as my Dr is concerned.",1
3293,anxiety,I've always had an idea in my head that I would do anything and everything to avoid taking medications and I've been convinced that I can deal with this on my own and if I can't then I'm doing something wrong.,1
3294,anxiety,I feel like I am in a pit that I cannot escape from.,1
3295,anxiety,"I know that I am anxious all the time and terrified of fucking up and I know for sure that the more anxious I am, the more I cannot focus well and think straight and the more likely it is for me to fuck up .. and somehow, everytime I do, I feel like I just want to belittle myself so much that I deliberately and purposefully want to see myself covered in blood and bruises because I feel like I deserve it!",1

3367,anxiety,Is there a way to lose the worst bits of anxiety while keeping the bits that are perhaps somewhat helpful?,1
3368,anxiety,"Or have I got this all wrong and it's not anxiety (but perhaps something else) that makes me productive, etc?",1

3382,anxiety,I haven't touched weed since but i still feel spaced out.,1
3383,anxiety,Any insight would be appreciated.,1
3384,anxiety,I also noticed when i don't focus on my worry i feel a little better,1

3409,anxiety,Has anyone else who's dealt with anxiety their entire lives become very controlling in their relationships as a way to cope?,1
3410,anxiety,Speaking to my therapist I'm realizing that my method of coping with the intense anxiety I've faced in life was to become so organized that I thought I could control everything.,1

3461,anxiety,I'm really not sure whether I should start to model myself over him or just remain like this.,1
3462,anxiety,"I feel alone, because I feel like people don't think ""I was having a panic attack"" as a legitimate excuse to miss something.",1
3463,anxiety,"I don't even feel like others with panic attacks 100% get it, because I don't really get that feeling of a heart attack or anything, I feel like my panic attacks are weird, and all the stuff I read about ways to help seem to be for people who get the heart attack feelings.",1

3478,anxiety,everything flutters through my head.,1
3479,anxiety,like i think i’m annoying him by asking him to spend so much time with me??,1
3480,anxiety,(he’s never expressed this.,1
3481,anxiety,he’s actually expressed the complete opposite which is nice) but i feel like i’m being too clingy and too annoying leading me to want to spend some alone time in my apartment but my apartment just makes me more sad because i’m alone and i feel useless like no one care??,1

3487,anxiety,In the past I've tried to solve things but that doesn't help.,1
3488,anxiety,"I've tried just listening and agreeing or offering comments like ""that does sound bad"" or ""I understand"" but those don't seem to help either.",1

3490,anxiety,I'm at a loss as to what I need to do or be for her.,1

3494,anxiety,I am not on meds though I am trying Gaba since I had some anyway.,1
3495,anxiety,"To make it even more fun, my sister is mad at me because I am ""chronically self centered"" because I forgot to get back to her about possibly getting together for dinner, because I am shut down.",1
3496,anxiety,Wtf.,1
3497,anxiety,I did this to myself.,1
3498,anxiety,I knew I needed to study and I just kept putting it off and putting it off.,1
3499,anxiety,I knew I didn’t do well but I didn’t think I bombed it so fucking hard.,1
3500,anxiety,I’m going to have to lie to everyone about it.,1
3501,anxiety,I drove the 10 minutes home with my fiance on the phone helping me count my breathing.,1

3507,anxiety,I'm having so much anxiety and I feel that there is no hope for me right now.,1
3508,anxiety,It took a lot of effort to post this.,1
3509,anxiety,I panic very easily.,1
3510,anxiety,I also have trust issues.,1
3511,anxiety,"Help me out here, fellow anxious, if we gather maybe we could create an elaborate plan to help me avoid this, idk I have phone phobia.",1
3512,anxiety,These are really important conversations that I'll be calling to have and a lot depends on my explaining things and my demeanour and a lot of things could go so terribly wrong and I'm just so absolutely socially inept and phone calls are one of the worst ways for me to say words and make sense and - please help.,1

3514,anxiety,"I suddenly became very weak, dizzy, and tired..spending days in bed.",1
3515,anxiety,"Never had a real fever..docs put it down to a post viral fatigue from something I had caught..I would get better for a few days then I would ""crash"" again.",1
3516,anxiety,It wasn't until I had had countless tests done that came back clean..and went to the ER one last time in desperation to figure out what was wrong that the doc sent me to the pysch as he suspected depression and anxiety (I had lost 10lbs by then..and didn't weigh much to begin with).,1
3517,anxiety,I was diagnosed with moderate-severe clinical depression and anxiety..the pysch ruled out CFS and lyme etc since my symptoms would come and go and kept changing by the day.,1
3518,anxiety,Was prescribed ssri meds..but this gave me the worst panic attack I have experienced in my life..aaand another ambulance ride..,1
3519,anxiety,(I suffer from Major Depression/Anxiety/Fibromyalgia and I wrote this as an example of what I feel on an average day so that people who don't have mental illness can understand) Hollowed out doesn't quite cover the feeling.,1
3520,anxiety,Because inside this shell are millions of raw nerve endings feeling everything that brushes by.,1
3521,anxiety,Everything is so raw.,1
3522,anxiety,Between the mental and physical pain it's incredibly hard to stay grounded.,1
3523,anxiety,Hello So I've had chronic social anxiety since I can remember.,1
3524,anxiety,"I had a pretty traumatic childhood, which has resulted in me being socially awkward, and very nervous in social setting.",1
3525,anxiety,Fast forward to this week- I've been invited to a party this weekend.,1
3526,anxiety,"I would love to go, but to be honest, I'm very scared to go.",1
3527,anxiety,"I've been feeling off the past day where I felt I was gonna get sick and just felt weird, I'm at my dads house visiting and have diarrhea now and my back hurts, I think it's from this bed.",1
3528,anxiety,And now I'm starting to tell myself maybe I'm having a heart attack.,1
3529,anxiety,"Maybe I felt chest pain a second ago, but can't tell if it was real or not??",1
3530,anxiety,Someone tell me I'm crazy and I'm ok,1

3533,anxiety,I've fucked up my future lol.,1
3534,anxiety,I have constant stomach pains and stiff pains everywhere from all the anxiety I feel on 24/7 basis.,1
3535,anxiety,"Also my health is declining as well, so that's fun.",1
3536,anxiety,Friends and loved ones (who don't have anxiety) keep telling me to relax and since it's such a busy place it's nothing personal and to not think it worry about it.,1
3537,anxiety,Which I'm sure is 100% true but not matter how many times it's said anxiety never believes it.,1
3538,anxiety,I start my next shift in 30 minutes and stating to freak out and have small panic attacks which haven't happened in a while.,1
3539,anxiety,"I've been so good about keeping my anxiety in control and not putting myself in anxious situations, and this job pushed that (being the public eye and fucking up is one my biggest triggers) but the pay and reputation of the company is widely known and it's one of the most wanted jobs in my town.",1
3540,anxiety,Does anyone have any advice or maybe gone thru something similar and came out on top?,1
3541,anxiety,I don’t know how it’s physically possible to be this anxious on this level of medication.,1
3542,anxiety,"To be fair my anxiety and racing thoughts about going back to the first employer are so bad that I can’t even really watch TV, so healthy coping mechanisms are pretty sparse.",1
3543,anxiety,I’m really only posting this because I seriously can’t believe that a) I can physiologically sustain this and b) that I still have been going to work every day.,1
3544,anxiety,"I guess I come home and break down every day too, so there’s that.",1
3545,anxiety,"I wish so bad I hadn’t done that, and it’s like my brain is living in this loop of both regret and fear, as well as rage at myself for thinking that would be the answer.",1
3546,anxiety,"I'm not exaggerating in that I legitimately, 100%, thought I was going to die.",1
3547,anxiety,I don't think I've ever been so scared.,1
3548,anxiety,I keep a diary and reading back on what I wrote at that time makes me cry at the memory.,1
3549,anxiety,Something else new I've been experiencing is numbness.,1
3550,anxiety,I've never felt numb before but it's been happening more lately.,1
3551,anxiety,"My heart races and my hands start to sweat, I immediately feel as if I need to pee and then worry as there’s no bathroom (on the train at least).",1
3552,anxiety,The unknown is the problem here – how long will I be trapped?,1
3553,anxiety,"I know this is stupid – I know I am fine, I know in all likelihood we will be moving again shortly, but it’s the constant what ifs that set me off.",1
3554,anxiety,"I look around and everyone else looks perfectly calm – perhaps mumbling at the inconvenience, but I am gripped with fear.",1
3555,anxiety,I hate it.,1
3556,anxiety,"I can get from feeling super bad (aka anxiety) to feeling super good with just one single thought (they're, most of the times, exaggerated).",1
3557,anxiety,"And then, with another thought I can get from feeling super good to feeling super bad.",1
3558,anxiety,"This is a matter of just seconds and these switchs can last for hours, stop and then come back again.",1
3559,anxiety,When I get the bad feelings it's just awful and the only way I can cope with them is thinking of a way of killing myself.,1
3560,anxiety,"Then, when I get the good ones, I completely forget about the sensation the bad ones gave me and I see the bright side.",1
3561,anxiety,It can take weeks until the problem is solved or I realise I was anxious over nothing.,1
3562,anxiety,Recently I'm moving home due to family circumstances and it's something I didn't want to really do yet but I am having to and the place I'm moving to is lovely but I'm really anxious over it and whether I'm doing the right thing.,1
3563,anxiety,These thoughts I'm having are causing this really dark awful feeling.,1
3564,anxiety,Is this feeling common?,1
3565,anxiety,I wondered if this feeling is my intuition but I don't believe it is I think it's purely anxiety.,1
3566,anxiety,Over the past couple of years I've been getting increasingly afraid of road trips.,1
3567,anxiety,I've been terrified of dying in car accidents.,1
3568,anxiety,I don't know entirely knowing where this fear is coming from.,1
3569,anxiety,I was in a super minor fender bender as a teenager but that was it.,1
3570,anxiety,"In college, I lived in a city with insane traffic and regular accidents but I never experienced an accident myself.",1
3571,anxiety,This isn’t so much a cry for help but I just want to rant about all my problems somewhere and this seems like the place.,1
3572,anxiety,I’ve had anxiety for a few years now but this year I’m full on depressed.,1
3573,anxiety,I’ve considered running away so many fucking time but I always feel bad for those I’m trying to leave.,1
3574,anxiety,I’ve never self harmed (thankfully) but I’m always bummed out and paranoid.,1
3575,anxiety,College is surprisingly the only thing that doesn’t make me anxious.,1
3576,anxiety,"I described my symptoms to friends and they would say its normal, or that they have thoughts of their own and that it's all in my head.",1
3577,anxiety,"But I knew this wasn't normal, I'm an optimistic person and I'm not afraid of people, I actually like socializing and meeting people, but my anxiety gets in the way and my fear of judgment.. but even I knew that I wasn't nervous, but my body was reacting in a way... idk how to describe it.",1
3578,anxiety,"I just wished that I could go for drinks with my girls and when guys came over, I wouldnt over analyze and get nervous... and start twitching because of all the rush of blood to my face...",1
3579,anxiety,"I dealt with this for years, and was going to just live like this... but then I went to a bar to meet up with my girlfriends but arrived late.",1
3580,anxiety,Once in the bar I saw a group of guys sitting with them.,1
3581,anxiety,"Now the past week, anxiety has hit harder than it's ever hit before.",1
3582,anxiety,"I'm checking snapchat scores, social media activitiy, last active etc which i know is already grounds for unhealthy relationships.",1
3583,anxiety,"The problem is when we were together, and whilst we were texting chat its absolutely perfect until the past week.",1
3584,anxiety,"The texts are shorter, my messages are being ignored (she's online but not reading my message) for hours on end, there's no good night / good morning message, it's all very limited and short.",1
3585,anxiety,"I've tried to challenge her on it as a means of settling my anxiety but this was met with a touch of hostility, in that 'yes everything is fine, i don't need to be in constant communication with you,' but I'm just so concerned that she's pulling away or losing interest and its all falling out of my hands.",1
3586,anxiety,I just can't do it.,1
3587,anxiety,"Some days I think: ""You know what, i'll do it!"".",1
3588,anxiety,But I never actually did it.,1
3589,anxiety,"There's a fucking huge wall, a Trump wall, stopping me.",1
3590,anxiety,"All I wanted was a job, now I got a job offer but the wall is stopping me.",1

4089,anxiety,"After two half hour sessions, they decided to refer me back to psychology.",1
4090,anxiety,I've been on a waiting list for the past 4 months and am beginning to lose hope.,1
4091,anxiety,"I will browse a book on a subject that I want or need to study, research it, think about how it's going to be, then when the time for studying comes, I'm thinking about something else.",1
4092,anxiety,"Sometimes I spend the day thinking about that hardcore workout I'm gong to do in the evening, and then I spend the whole workout session thinking about something else.",1
4093,anxiety,Sometimes even when I'm talking to people I like I realize my mind will wander.,1
4094,anxiety,Does anyone feel these things?,1
4095,anxiety,"Do you think it's related to anxiety, or do I have ADHD or something else?",1
4096,anxiety,I can have it in front of me and still overthink and ask my self over and over.,1
4097,anxiety,Any advice or opinions?,1
4098,anxiety,I don’t suffer a lot when I’m busy at work or with friends.,1
4099,anxiety,I work as a security guard at a busy office building and everytime i make eye contact with my people  I can literally see them shuddering inside.,1
4100,anxiety,"It probably down to the fact I have an intense stare and tend to stare in people's too eyes long,but I don't know what  the social etiquette is ,what do you do when you're walking along a corridor and you bump into someone you just said hi to a few seconds ago, what do you do when you turn around and unintentionally lock eyes with a work colleague.",1
4101,anxiety,"Please someone help,teach my how to make normal eye contact in social situations.",1
4102,anxiety,It's getting to the point now where work colleagues are going out their  way to avoid making eye contact with me.,1
4103,anxiety,Please help,1
4104,anxiety,One of my flatmates has started distancing  herself from me and I don't know what to do.,1
4105,anxiety,I've never experienced this before as I've never really had a friendship this close with someone before.,1
4106,anxiety,"We used to see each other multiple times a day, when we were both in the flat we used to spend loads of time in each other's rooms just chilling and chatting.",1
4107,anxiety,But recently she's been spending more time with other people rather than me.,1
4108,anxiety,Before today I don't think I saw her for about a week which is crazy considering how close we were and that we live under the same roof.,1
4109,anxiety,Sure enough she always sends us home.,1
4110,anxiety,Every Wednesday I feel intense dread.,1
4111,anxiety,I'm afraid to go into work the next day.,1
4112,anxiety,A few of u may remember but just about a week ago I contemplated suicide.,1
4113,anxiety,I always have anxiety and sadness.,1
4114,anxiety,Over the past 6 years I've settled into a career that I'm really good at.,1
4115,anxiety,Unfortunately I've had a slew of bosses that I had trouble dealing with.,1
4116,anxiety,One of my biggest issues is that I'm prone to making small mistakes.,1
4117,anxiety,"They're not catastrophic, but they happen more often than I'd like.",1
4118,anxiety,"I've had supervisors that get really annoyed over these small mistakes, and they make me feel like my job is on the line.",1
4119,anxiety,"So I've recently started having anxiety attacks where it becomes hard to breathe, with the subject regarding many topics, mainly obsessing about relationships and government bureaucracies that I have to handle lately, and mainly where my life is going.",1
4120,anxiety,I feel kind of lost.,1
4121,anxiety,"My spouse and I live in a war-torn country full of people trying to rip you off any chance they get, everyone is rude and generally don't fit the way I've been brought up, everything is expensive and the stress is beyond measure here.",1
4122,anxiety,Not how we were brought up.,1
4123,anxiety,We're waiting for me and her to finish college so we can get out of here and move to a civilized nation elsewhere.,1
4124,anxiety,"It sorta works, but I don't like the feeling of being deadheaded.",1
4125,anxiety,I also don't have a good relationships with doctors considering I was misdiagnosed with bipolar as a teen and given lithium... Had a terrible reaction to it.,1
4126,anxiety,What are some more natural remedies or self-help you all do to keep yourself in the proper mindset to calm your triggers?,1
4127,anxiety,"I've started meditation and taking CBD oil (which work great, but kinda expensive), but it doesn't seem to be enough.",1
4128,anxiety,I just want to start living and be able to enjoy life.,1
4129,anxiety,"Deep breathing, reminding myself that I'm just irrationally panicking, promising myself to take it step by step, analyzing the emotional baggage I've placed on this paper.",1
4130,anxiety,"For weeks now, it's been sitting on my computer, mocking me.",1
4131,anxiety,"It's late, and I'm slowly loosing motivation to even try.",1
4132,anxiety,Can anyone help?,1
4133,anxiety,I really want to try and edit the paper into something worth reading without feeling like I can't breathe.,1
4134,anxiety,So I have been suffering from chronic anxiety for eight years.The kind where you feel some enemy is breathing down on your neck always.I don't want to get into the details of this matter because it's is very personal.,1
4135,anxiety,But from the beginning of this anxiety my breathing got messed up.,1
4136,anxiety,Like I was alternating my breathing between hyperventilation and shallow breathing through out the day for all these years.,1
4137,anxiety,"During these last five years I have suffered bone TB, now stomach gastritis for three years,also found out I have recurring kidney stones in my left kidney.Before all this begun I was relatively healthy without any complicated disease like  bone tb or stomach gastritis.",1
4138,anxiety,So it seems to me this long chronic anxiety and the resulting hyperventilation and shallow breathing and high blood pressure did make my immune system rather weak or damaged.,1
4139,anxiety,And I'll get an intense feeling of impending doom.,1
4140,anxiety,It lasts for less than a minute and then I'll fall back asleep.,1
4141,anxiety,It usually happens during naps.,1
4142,anxiety,I thought it was a seizure when it first happened.,1
4143,anxiety,Has this happened to anyone else?,1
4144,anxiety,Etc etc etc.,1
4145,anxiety,"My brain takes this one little choice -should I go back in the water- and blows it up so big that I spend 20 minutes trying to figure out what I should do, and I end up frozen unable to make ANY decision.",1
4146,anxiety,Does this happen to anyone else?,1
4147,anxiety,How do you deal with this?,1
4148,anxiety,So I’ve been taking 40mg paroxetine for around 3 months (I don’t go to her straight away) and have been fine until the past two weeks.,1
4149,anxiety,I’m beginning to notice that my anxiety is again incredibly high a lot of the time.,1
4150,anxiety,By listening to my body I’ve come to realise that caffeine is triggering me.,1
4151,anxiety,NOW this is new.,1
4152,anxiety,"I’ve been drinking coffee since I was around 17 (22 now) and I’ve never had an issue (infact, it used to put me to sleep) but now whenever I have a coffee (French press at home or latte from a barista) within about 30 minutes I begin to shake and uncontrollably sweat.",1
4153,anxiety,I don't know whether to call the crisis team see if theyll stay on the phone as i leave to distract myself.,1
4154,anxiety,Im determind not to be as agoraphobic as i was i will not be stuck inside trapped by myself.,1
4155,anxiety,Yet here i am frozen in bed scared to leave in case it means i even start getting ready to go towards to front door.,1
4156,anxiety,"I know i should eat, but the anxiety part of me keeps trying to convince me i dont need to eat i'll be ok if i just stay inside safe.",1
4157,anxiety,"I dont know what to do to be liked again, i guess it would be different if she had hated me from the beginning but that just isnt the case.",1
4158,anxiety,She also hates my boyfriend and doesnt allow him anywhere near her house.,1
4159,anxiety,"I cant move because the rent is only $500 and I cant afford anything else, and yes, I do have a job.",1
4160,anxiety,"I've even asked her why she thinks I'm so stupid and she said ""because nobody taught you these things"" so I guess shes helping, it's just hard to know that I'm a failure.",1
4161,anxiety,"I try to meditate and to think very very very deep before I say anything, like to try and think of every outcome and if it might make her hate me more then I shouldnt say it.",1
4162,anxiety,For the past couple months I have had really bad soreness and tightness in my upper back and neck.,1
4163,anxiety,Sometimes it gets so stiff I can barely move my head.,1
4164,anxiety,At first i thought it was a physical injury so I went to the doctors and had an xray but they could not find anything.,1
4165,anxiety,I notice it flares up when im anxious.,1
4166,anxiety,"I have tried many self massages, creams, baths, pads, you name it.",1
4167,anxiety,Anxiety kicked in but then heightened by all the fucking coffee I drank from working before the meet.,1
4168,anxiety,"I started shaking, I couldn't lift my head up.",1
4169,anxiety,"My girlfriend and I stepped out for a smoke, and I told her the situation, the guys moved away... they were hot too so thanks to my anxiety I missed out yet again on another golden opportunity.",1
4170,anxiety,"But once we got back to our seats, I told my girl that I recently got close to that I had anxiety and the symptoms, just casually because at this point its just a thing I have to tell people, but this time it wasn't to a fellow artist or designer, she was a nurse.",1
4171,anxiety,"Instead of saying yeah I have it to or yeah we all get like that, she asked me further questions.",1
4172,anxiety,I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep.,1
4173,anxiety,I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didnʻt want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldnʻt want to compare my stress to that.,1
4174,anxiety,"Just wondering if itʻs possible that this is like mild ""anxiety"" or I am just sleep deprived?",1
4175,anxiety,Also if its possible that anxiety can be come back after a decade of not having any noticeable events?,1
4176,anxiety,Thanks ahead of time for any help.,1
4177,anxiety,These thoughts are always a great source of frustration to me especially when I’m close to an artistic deadline like a gallery exposition that is coming soon.,1
4178,anxiety,I’m never confident enough to show what I do.,1
4179,anxiety,Even the minister of culture in my country has made some very positive criticisms about it but my mind always goes back to thinking those people are only saying these things to be nice.,1
4180,anxiety,"Honestly, does anyone else feel that way?",1
4181,anxiety,What do you do when this happens?,1
4182,anxiety,I desperately need a car and found a great opportunity but the previous owner died of a heart attack in it.,1
4183,anxiety,"Thats my number one cause of anxiety, the fear of heart attacks.",1
4184,anxiety,He was relatively healthy and young.,1
4185,anxiety,I feel like a big idiot for not taking it.,1
4186,anxiety,But I have vivid nightmares of me having heart attacks then I wake up with a panic attack that lasts hours.,1
4187,anxiety,I've been trying to avoid social media because I know how anxiety provoking it can be for me.,1
4188,anxiety,I joined it ultimately because I thought it would make me feel more connected to people.,1
4189,anxiety,"It kind of does, which I'm okay with.",1
4190,anxiety,"But of course, now I'm looking at everyone's highlight reels and friend count (which I'm especially envious of) and I can't help but feel like crap.",1
4191,anxiety,"My social life came to a standstill in my early 20s when I compartmentalized all facets of my life, ensuring the people I knew never intermingled.",1
4192,anxiety,"This has been affecting me for two weeks now, off and on.",1
4193,anxiety,It's a combination of terrifying and annoying.,1
4194,anxiety,"Randomly throughout the day, I will notice that it feels harder to breathe and I take deeper breaths than normal.",1
4195,anxiety,"Air coming in almost feels like it has viscosity to it, like molasses, which makes me cough.",1
4196,anxiety,"Most of the time, I don't cough up anything so it's dry.",1
4197,anxiety,"This even negatively impacts me more because it causes me relationship anxiety, every time I have a freak out about travelling I start getting intrusive thoughts like ""what if I get there and realize I don't love him or I'm not attracted to him"" or when he sends me a text that makes me happy my anxiety creeps in saying that I'm secretly forcing any positive feelings I have for him.",1
4198,anxiety,I know these are linked to my travel anxiety because they only pop up AFTER I've had a moment of freaking out thinking about the travel.,1
4199,anxiety,"Whenever we Skype, just talking to him feels like home, and talking about the upcoming trip feels just exciting, not nerve-wracking.",1
4200,anxiety,"This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it.",1
4201,anxiety,"I need to figure out how to calm all this anticipatory anxiety so I can just let myself enjoy my relationship, the excitement leading up to our trip, and even the trip itself (although I feel like once I'm there I'll be fine)!",1
4202,anxiety,I just told them I had too much anxiety and breaking up with my boyfriend made me really depressed.,1
4203,anxiety,"And that I didn't know what I'm going to do, maybe I'll find a job.",1
4204,anxiety,So now I just stay home and go on my computer all day.,1
4205,anxiety,I leave the house maybe twice a week.,1
4206,anxiety,I have constant feelings about being useless and that I'd be better off dead.,1
4207,anxiety,"So earlier today I was suffering from extreme derealization, depression, and anxiety.",1
4208,anxiety,So what I did is I let the thoughts free and whenever I got a tnhoguht I ignored it and I think I just suppressed my anxiety deep down.,1
4209,anxiety,Now instead of having a panic attack I'm having body symptoms of it.,1
4210,anxiety,I can't think myself form the symptoms.,1
4211,anxiety,I can't find the trigger it just happened.,1
4212,anxiety,I can't begin to summarise how I feel about her.,1
4213,anxiety,"I want to spend the rest of my life with this person, but I want to help work through this stuff together.",1
4214,anxiety,Once she goes into an anxiety spiral I'm completely at a loss of what to do apart from hold her and stroke her hair.,1
4215,anxiety,"What strategies can help break the spiral when she starts one, and how can I approach the topic of seeing a counsellor and developing mindfulness strategies without her going into a panic attack?",1
4216,anxiety,"Help me /r/anxiety, you're my only hope.",1
4217,anxiety,"I can't tell if that's me being a toxic person or not, and I feel guilty for feeling relieved.",1
4218,anxiety,"We were such good friends once, but I have to admit we hadn't talked about art or writing (the things that made us friends) for years.",1
4219,anxiety,"My anxiety has muddied the waters, and maybe all my shit and all my emotional abuse crap did ruin everything and it was all my fault.",1
4220,anxiety,Maybe I did end things because I'd felt blamed for 2 months straight and just wanted to get away from the anxiety it was all causing me.,1
4221,anxiety,"Maybe I should have been the one to grovel, because I'd fucked up so bad over the situation.",1
4222,anxiety,I didn’t sleep that night and eventually was fine.,1
4223,anxiety,Since then my anxiety has gotten worse- scary movies linger in my thoughts a little longer.,1
4224,anxiety,I’ve had a few mini panic attacks.,1
4225,anxiety,I can’t get intoxicated anymore Bc I don’t like my mind being In a different state.,1
4226,anxiety,I feel like a darkness is over me and I just feel scared all the time.,1
4227,anxiety,Which forced me to acknowledge that I haven’t been performing to my own expectations.,1
4228,anxiety,Enter the anxiety attack.,1
4229,anxiety,"Sobbing, shaking, fidgeting, and rambling.",1
4230,anxiety,"To top it all off, I threw away my xanex thinking that I didn’t need the safety net.",1
4231,anxiety,I thought I was done with all this...reality proved otherwise.,1
4232,anxiety,"I live alone, make sure my dog gets the exercise he needs, I keep my apartment tidy, I do my laundry, I make sure I’m eating good, I work out, and I still hang with friends and such.",1
4233,anxiety,"Really, the only time I play video games is after work (which is normally after 8:30pm) or when I’m off.",1
4234,anxiety,"Even when I’m off, I still do chores and such between playing games.",1
4235,anxiety,"Even though I’m good at getting this stuff done, I still feel like there’s this weight on my shoulders that I should do MORE.",1
4236,anxiety,Even when I cut video games out of the equation (which I did for the last week and a half) I still don’t do MORE because I’m normally too tired to do anything else.,1
4237,anxiety,"Hey guys, I'm 31, moved to a new city with my wife for the first time back in October, and am experiencing on and off anxiety for more or less the first time in my life.",1
4238,anxiety,A couple quick questions: 1.,1
4239,anxiety,How do I know whether I should see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?,1
4240,anxiety,Today was a horrible day from the get go and I had to call out because I cant function with other people (I work in retail) today so I claimed I had a fever.,1
4241,anxiety,"Of course it had to be memorial day weekend making it one of the worst times for this and they even of course said over the phone ""Well, this really puts us in a bind"".",1
4242,anxiety,Now I'm absolutely paranoid that they'll find out or they hate me now or I'll get fired for this.,1
4243,anxiety,I'm so paranoid I'm worried they'll see me or come to my house to check on me even though I know they would never do that.,1
4244,anxiety,I just wish someone could understand or sympathize/empathize with me for once.,1
4245,anxiety,"I suffered a concussion a month ago and I noticed it really has provoked my anxiety to be scared about getting worse and it has even led to me getting depressed and thinking of harming myself I have been like this before, I have had anxiety but not to this level.",1
4246,anxiety,I have felt better since the concussion has healed but I am worried I won't recover from my anxiety and I have been perscribed Celprix (Escitalopram) and unsure if I should take it.,1
4247,anxiety,I kind of feel like I can recover from this by getter back to my routine and return to work.,1
4248,anxiety,Anyone else been through a life changing injury and had some bad anxiety from it?,1
4249,anxiety,"This post was spurred by the fact that I was just scrolling through photos I took of my boyfriend last year and I found myself thinking, ""is this person actually my boyfriend?""",1
4250,anxiety,"I don't mean that in a sappy ""how did I get so lucky"" way (although I did luck out with him, for sure) but more in a ""how do I see this person all the time and still feel like I don't recognize him in photos"" way.",1
4251,anxiety,We've been together for over five years.,1
4252,anxiety,It just... it doesn't make any sense.,1
4253,anxiety,"Normally I only do this with people from high school, many of whom I haven't seen since we graduated six years ago.",1
4254,anxiety,That freaked me out.,1
4255,anxiety,I was tired after probably from a sugar crash and I immediately assumed I was going through a calcium OD and was going to end up in a coma.,1
4256,anxiety,Then I went home and opened a Snapchat and got deja vu (I thought I read that Snapchat before).,1
4257,anxiety,"I experience deja vu like that frequently, and googled it and it said I could have a brain condition or epilepsy...",1
4258,anxiety,If I’m going to have to live like this forever sometimes I wish I wouldn’t wake up.,1
4259,anxiety,"My anxiety caused me to become independent and cold towards him, but inside I was screaming.",1
4260,anxiety,All I wanted was for him to hold me and tell me everything was fine.,1
4261,anxiety,But my anxiety got the best of us and caused a rift.,1
4262,anxiety,We broke up for a week and then when we got back together we were really good for maybe a month or two and the same insecurities slipped in.,1
4263,anxiety,"Mind you, he has NEVER cheated or even acted interested in other girls.",1
4264,anxiety,Every morning I wake up and it's there on the exact same spot.,1
4265,anxiety,This has been happening for the past 4 days and I thought I need to reach out to someone if they can help me at all?,1
4266,anxiety,"I have convinced myself I have a brain tumour, I keep feeling dissociated and completely out of it I keep touching the same spot on my head like every 20 seconds like a compulsion and it's really getting me down.",1
4267,anxiety,When I swallow i feel as if i can feel a pulling sensation near the spot where this is happening.,1
4268,anxiety,It's not exactly giving me a headache but it's disturbing me to which i notice it.,1
4269,anxiety,"I feel like I'm letting this take over my life, I'm constantly worried, about what if is more then just anxiety.",1
4270,anxiety,"I went to the university psychiatrist, after a 15 min talk he gave some pills and he book the next consultation for a mouth later.",1
4271,anxiety,The psychologist is impossible to book because is full.,1
4272,anxiety,"My parents are away they worry so much,  they want me to come home,  I live 5 hours away from them (this includes flying).",1
4273,anxiety,"I just don't know, I feel really insecure about all of this.",1
4274,anxiety,I know it’s terrible and selfish and obviously people can be friends with each other but I just miss having a really strong and healthy friendship with another girl the way that we did.,1
4275,anxiety,"I want to have a good weekend but it feels impossible now, and I want everyone there to have a good weekend and I don’t want to make it bad.",1
4276,anxiety,I don’t know what to do.,1
4277,anxiety,So I just feel like crawling into my little isolation hole and being sad by myself while knowing that everyone hates me... to be honest I don’t know why I’m overthinking it cause honestly no one would care if I did isolate myself.,1
4278,anxiety,"It’s just I want to be better, not just for other people but for myself too.",1
4279,anxiety,"In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply.",1
4280,anxiety,"Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything.""",1
4281,anxiety,"At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice).",1
4282,anxiety,Again understandable.,1
4283,anxiety,"I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",1
4284,anxiety,"Not a huge amount of weight, but it was a big deal for me.",1
4285,anxiety,I was on the treadmill every night for 45 minutes.,1
4286,anxiety,I was doing good.,1
4287,anxiety,Now I can't be on the treadmill or I start feeling ill again.,1
4288,anxiety,"Anyway, after the garbage issue I ended up in the hospital again.",1
4289,anxiety,I feel like I'm dying.,1
4290,anxiety,I know that I'm not but I feel like it.,1
4291,anxiety,I'm at the end of a cold.,1
4292,anxiety,"Not a cold that I sometimes make up in my head, but an actual cold.",1
4293,anxiety,"Stuffy nose, chest congestion, scratchy throat.",1
4294,anxiety,"Rarely, I forget about the symptoms.",1
4295,anxiety,"Rarely, they don't bother me, but they still are occurring always.",1
4296,anxiety,I have seen two different doctors about this.,1
4297,anxiety,They ruled out a few things and suggested that it was purely anxiety and that I go on an SSRI.,1
4298,anxiety,"I have not gone on an SSRI yet, however I am planning to do so ASAP.",1
4299,anxiety,So I'm currently in a decision if I suffer from social anxiety or not.,1
4300,anxiety,If I can I will ask ny step mom tonight as we like to watch TV at night diwn stairs with a cuo of tea but thats if she doesn't go to bed straight away.,1
4301,anxiety,I know I'm too scared and will just freeze up to ask her to stay down.,1
4302,anxiety,"I want to tell my step mom because I know she will tell my dad, I wouldn't be able to tell anyone else accept for my nan.",1
4303,anxiety,I'm in a really tough situation right now as I want to see a doctor or therapist about this but I need to tell someone first.,1
4304,anxiety,Itʻs at the point where I am scared I canʻt focus on driving and will crash or just space out going 45 mph.,1
4305,anxiety,"In the past Ive had 3 major ""panic attacks(?)""",1
4306,anxiety,where my whole body is in pins and needles and I canʻt breathe well but they were all triggered by major emotional events.,1
4307,anxiety,I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep.,1
4308,anxiety,I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didnʻt want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldnʻt want to compare my stress to that.,1
4309,anxiety,"""What is nothing is real?",1
4310,anxiety,"What if everything is a figment of your imagination?""",1
4311,anxiety,"I panicked, and grabbed the couch, but the voice inside me said ""It doesn't matter if you grab the couch, what is the couch isn't real?",1
4312,anxiety,"What if your house isn't real?""",1
4313,anxiety,"At this time I called my brother, sobbing, and told him to get my mom.",1
4314,anxiety,"I keep alternating between crying, laughing, and freaking out.",1
4315,anxiety,I'm also really upset right now and my boyfriend isn't making me feel better.,1
4316,anxiety,"He keeps saying things like, this is all your fault and no one is making you think these things.",1
4317,anxiety,And to be patient with things....,1
4318,anxiety,I feel like this is going to kill me?,1
4319,anxiety,My heart is palpitating because I finally responded in a group chat that I'm not so active in because I'm scared nobody is going to care what I say.,1
4320,anxiety,So I finally responded this morning because the chat seems active and it couldn't possibly hurt right?,1
4321,anxiety,I'm trying to beat my anxiety.,1
4322,anxiety,"Well, my fears were confirmed.",1
4323,anxiety,Nobody responded to what I texted.,1
4324,anxiety,I always feel like no one actually likes me and they just put up with me out of pity.,1
4325,anxiety,"It’s a vicious cycle, because that insecurity makes me more self-conscious and standoffish, which makes me more unlikeable.",1

4575,anxiety,I'm so scared I hate nausea I hate it.,1
4576,anxiety,This kind of thing just makes me want to stop.,1

4578,anxiety,It stresses me out..,1
4579,anxiety,Anyone else have this issue or get anxious over this?,1
4580,anxiety,Or am I just being silly?,1

4582,anxiety,"I'm torn between wanting to be alone, wanting to reach out for help, talking to people just so I can yell and push them away.",1

4584,anxiety,"That's a lie, I think I do but I don't want to.",1
4585,anxiety,Any effort is exhausting and I can't bring myself to fix it.,1
4586,anxiety,I feel like a complete and utter fuck up.,1
4587,anxiety,And it just fucking hurts.,1
4588,anxiety,I’m filled with what if’s.,1
4589,anxiety,"“What if you didn’t ever use pot and was that what made you feel physically ill?” “What if it wasn’t that, but just high anxiety?” “What if I pushed through and got the job and things turned out well?",1
4590,anxiety,"How happy would you be compared to where you are now?” (I should mention I am not at a great place in my life right now in many ways, including employment).",1
4591,anxiety,For ever since I can remember I have suffered from anxiety.,1

4602,anxiety,I'm crying over everything.,1
4603,anxiety,I'm struggling at work to get basic tasks done.,1
4604,anxiety,I am SO HEAVILY OVERWHELMED by the smallest things.,1
4605,anxiety,My sink was so full of dishes to the point where I had no clean ones left and because the pile was so high I couldn't go near it and just cried.,1
4606,anxiety,I think it’s possible that these feelings are coming from the fact that he has said he loves me while drunk but can’t say it sober.,1
4607,anxiety,"I haven’t brought his up to him, but it makes me feel like he can’t say it because of his ex.",1
4608,anxiety,"Which I understand, but it also makes me sad that he’s not excited to be in love with me.",1
4609,anxiety,"I think part of me also feels like a second choice, or like I’m being compared to her.",1

4619,anxiety,I'm terrified to talk but tired of living like this.,1
4620,anxiety,"Tired of the nocturnal panic attacks, tired of crying in the shower, tired of not feeling in control of my head, tired of the pointless thought circles that eat me up daily on something that doesn't matter.",1
4621,anxiety,Maybe kind of nauseous?,1
4622,anxiety,Not in a normal nauseated feeling.,1
4623,anxiety,"Its more like that pit of my stomach, I'm about to get in big trouble, or I'm waiting for the cops to come pick me up or something haha.",1
4624,anxiety,"Like, it has that prickle in my spine to it.",1
4625,anxiety,And that restlessness in my head.,1

4628,anxiety,My heart rate feels like it’s shaking the whole bed.,1
4629,anxiety,Im dying.,1
4630,anxiety,TLDR i got friendzoned at the beach and I cant take it like a man,1
4631,anxiety,After talking with my psych she made me realize that anxiety has been the route of my negative feelings and it was likely anxiety causing depression.,1
4632,anxiety,"Despite this, however, she never seemed to understand just how severe my symptoms were.",1
4633,anxiety,"I would try to stay calm and describe how i felt to the best of my ability, however it wasn't until she saw me have an anxiety attack over asking her a \_very\_ simple question that she finally understood the severity.",1
4634,anxiety,"She said I seemed to downplay how I felt, so I took this into account for future reference.",1
4635,anxiety,"Eventually I move on to starting antidepressants, citalopram to start off.",1
4636,anxiety,"I am quite introverted and the broken friendship I had with my previous roommate made me feel very anxious, so I moved into an apartment on my own.",1
4637,anxiety,"I love living alone, but when I have severe anxiety attacks it becomes lonely and almost unbearable.",1
4638,anxiety,I sometimes think so much that it feels like I am going crazy.,1
4639,anxiety,"I have terrifying thoughts and I make up scenarios in which I have some terrible condition, or I am dying.",1
4640,anxiety,"My parents know that I have anxiety, but never took it too seriously.",1
4641,anxiety,She has not once shown disappointment.,1
4642,anxiety,"When she sees me get frustrated, she lays next to me and holds me.",1
4643,anxiety,Asks me what I need to relax.,1
4644,anxiety,But it's becoming a self perpetuating cycle and I'm getting panicky that this is going to drive a wedge between us because she will start to feel that she doesn't excite me or satisfy me or whatever.,1
4645,anxiety,"Before anyone asks, the pipes all work.",1
4646,anxiety,"This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it.",1
4647,anxiety,"I need to figure out how to calm all this anticipatory anxiety so I can just let myself enjoy my relationship, the excitement leading up to our trip, and even the trip itself (although I feel like once I'm there I'll be fine)!",1
4648,anxiety,"This is the same anxiety that has stopped me before, and I am NOT letting it stop me again.",1
4649,anxiety,"To anybody who's experienced this before, what tips or strategies can you give me to help overcome it?",1
4650,anxiety,"TL;DR- Very anxious about upcoming trip because I'm afraid of being trapped/away from the comfort of my home, to the point where it's affecting other parts of my life, how do I get over the anticipatory anxiety so I can enjoy myself?",1
4651,anxiety,**I don't want to be anxious in drawing class.,1
4652,anxiety,"** It's supposed to be my escape, my one place where I can do what I want and be who I choose.",1
4653,anxiety,Instead it's turning out to be a trigger for anxiety.,1
4654,anxiety,I refuse to drop my drawing class- I've already committed to trying to be an artist.,1
4655,anxiety,What kind of artist doesn't take drawing in high school?,1
4656,anxiety,"Hey, So I come from a middle class family and study far away from my parents for university (already scary for me as you can imagine).",1
4657,anxiety,After going home this winter my parents dropped the bombshell on me that they are struggling to pay my tuition.,1
4658,anxiety,"The thing is, although we are not super rich or anything, my fathers work covers 80% of my tuition and housing, the reason that my parents are unable to pay is that my dad is fairly disorganized and let his expenses build up.",1
4659,anxiety,My tuition is due this friday and I just called my parents and woke them up to inform them that its getting really serious now (my dad promised to make an arrangement with his friend to pay my tuition).,1
0,ptsd,I'm just blown away by this doctor's willingness to help.,0
1,ptsd,Bottom line?,0

15,ptsd,"This is not a super uncommon thing for a woman to experience <url> which includes my favorite-ever Wikipedia “For [alternate related article], see...”), but for most women, it resolves itself quickly after the baby is born.",0
16,ptsd,"For my spouse, it didn’t, and she started seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist.",0
17,ptsd,"This maybe helped, maybe didn’t.",0
18,ptsd,Somewhere in there we settled on a very (relatively speaking) effective combination of mental health meds that stabilized symptoms.,0
19,ptsd,"We had our second child in 2015, after which an injury led to the discovery of a debilitating and incurable connective tissue disorder.",0
20,ptsd,"The symptoms from this have been getting worse since then, and a good chunk of time from 2015 until now has been discovering what’s going on, coming to grips with a new reality, and managing those symptoms.",0
21,ptsd,Overall we’ve had a very healthy supportive relationship with strong shared values.,0
22,ptsd,I kept my head up and demanded the respect I deserve.,0
23,ptsd,I was very polite and expect the same.,0
24,ptsd,"She wasn’t, so I put her in her place (she reprimanded me for leaving my gowns hung up in the dressing room).",0
25,ptsd,I came back to try on another gown and she goes you could at least bring them back.,0
26,ptsd,Mind you I have a one year old in my cart....,0
27,ptsd,"I'm gonna try and get some sleep as it's the middle of the night here, and I hope I get through tomorrow with a single trigger, like I always wish for before I go to sleep.",0

32,ptsd,she came up with the brilliant idea of throwing a brick with a pie recipe tied to it through his window (i dont know).,0
33,ptsd,she told me to drive her to his house so she could do that and i said i didn't think it was a good idea.,0
34,ptsd,she told me if i didn't do it she would drunk drive there with my little brothers in the car.,0
35,ptsd,i haven't seen her in 6 and a half years.,0
36,ptsd,Ok so firstly I should say she hasn't been formally diagnosed but it's at this point a logical conclusion that she's suffering some kind of ptsd from a rape that she endured a couple years back.,0
37,ptsd,It was before I knew her and when we met she seemed to be pretty stable.,0
38,ptsd,Although I know now that's not the case.,0

1745,relationships,"(I should note, our first year together we went to the Maldives, second year we bought a house & went to Croatia, Venice, Belgium, Lots of weekends away - I'm not exactly lacking trips away) *I'm content and rarely feel unhappy these days, but is that a replacement of happiness?",0
1746,relationships,* Is this just a January blues thing that will go as the year starts moving on and I get back into the swing of things?,0
1747,relationships,I was dealing with depression for months feeling like I'd failed life at 18 and quit my job to finish off my college education and thats where we met.,0
1748,relationships,We were in the same class and used to stare at each other all day long so i followed her on instagram and noticed she was going to a club in my town that night so convinced my friend to come out as i really needed to bump into this girl and give it a shot.,0
1749,relationships,so we did.,0
1750,relationships,"When i walked in, she was there it, was crazy we locked eyes and without saying much she walked up and just started kissing me.",0
1751,relationships,we were guy and girl from that moment we did so much stuff together like holidays then she even moved into my parents place.,0
1752,relationships,Really hoping someone might have some insight for me!,0
1753,relationships,"A couple years ago I (31,F) befriended one of colleagues (28,M).",0
1754,relationships,"We were working for a small company that was also hemorrhaging cash, and eventually it was just him, me and some older coworkers in this open space office.",0
1755,relationships,"Anyway, we really got along!",0
1756,relationships,"We would have lunches, text in the evenings and weekends, and often go to the pub after work.",0
1757,relationships,They were late.,0
1758,relationships,"They tried to play it cool with the excuse they gave, but J had this grin on his face and Lux had the flushes look she gets when she has sex.",0
1759,relationships,And then Lux said she was going to fix her hair and left to the bathroom and after a while J said he was going to see if she needed help.,0
1760,relationships,Obviously they left to have sex.,0
1761,relationships,"I mean, fine, but I thought that was a bit disrespectful.",0
1762,relationships,But 19 and 39?,0
1763,relationships,to me I feel like that is someone older than my current age dating an age that seems like a child to me....,0
1764,relationships,"I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a "" normal"" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any "" life skills"" and his answer was ""  not really"".",0
1765,relationships,What are people's thoughts on this?,0
1766,relationships,"The other problem is, I genuinely believe Brian's father wants a relationship with our daughter.",0
1767,relationships,to which he replied that they had broken up.,0
1768,relationships,We met for drinks and he gave a heartfelt apology for having pressured me.,0
1769,relationships,"Slowly, we began seeing more of each other and the relationship turned physical.",0
1770,relationships,"We both live in the Pacific Northwest, but he's going to be moving to his hometown in the southeast at the end of this month.",0
1771,relationships,I'm moving to the southwest next month.,0
1772,relationships,"Okay so a bit of background, me and my girlfriend are in our second year of college (my subjects make a freshman though hehe) and have been together for 6 months.",0
1773,relationships,I want to be an ambassador and she wants to go into marketing.,0
1774,relationships,"Every day we spend time together, there isn't a moment where the two of us don't end up talking about our future.",0
1775,relationships,"To be more specific, we always end up talking extensively about marriage, what to name our daughter, how many golden retrievers to get and the like.",0
1776,relationships,"Don't get me wrong, I love her to bits and I enjoy talking to her about these things, it's just that I'm slightly worried that maybe she is in love with the idea of me, and I with the idea of her.",0
1777,relationships,I'm running out of ideas for how we can talk to one another more often.,0
1778,relationships,She'll be starting grad school in August.,0
1779,relationships,"I've been through grad school already myself, and I know how time consuming it is.",0
1780,relationships,She'll be busy.,0
1781,relationships,Neither one at all my fault but thanks for thinking it is.,0
1782,relationships,tl;dr We broke up.,0
1783,relationships,"If dude is so in love with his solitude he can have it, if he's so worried about resentment and arguments he doesn't have to worry about those either.",0
1784,relationships,Maybe next time he'll think about what he wants and is willing to do before he opens his mouth.,0
1785,relationships,and how that would intersect with a potential partner’s attitude.,0
1786,relationships,You’ve probably seen the posts on here: a woman gave birth four months ago and her husband is pissed off because her breasts are sore and he can’t play with them.,0
1787,relationships,A woman gave birth three months ago and her husband is pressuring her for PiV sex even though she is still uncomfortable.,0
1788,relationships,"A woman doesn’t enjoy sexual play with her breasts anymore after breastfeeding because it’s a mammary gland and not a sex organ, and the husband gets pissed because he wants to touch her breasts and apparently isn’t aware of other erogenous zones.",0
1789,relationships,"These were posts I remember reading on here for some relevant examples, but I can go on.",0
1790,relationships,"**TL;DR** **BF thinks being called a lady jokingly is an insult and emasculating, I disagree, what do ?",0
1791,relationships,"Hi everyone, I'm not sure if this goes here or under parenting.",0
1792,relationships,"I met ""Bob"" in a big city, moved with him to his parents property to start a business/farm.",0
1793,relationships,"He immediately went into 30,000 debt building an unnecessary smithy and had to get a job so we couldn't start the business after all.",0
1794,relationships,"I bought a used car so I could get out sometimes and look for a job, he took the car to work (instead of his retired parent's car as planned) so I was stuck at home again.",0
1795,relationships,"I got pregnant, we got married.",0
1796,relationships,I sat her down and told her that she is ruining her chances of having a relationship with my husband by how strong she is coming on.,0
1797,relationships,I told her that she is pushing him away and making him uncomfortable.,0
1798,relationships,"She seemed to take that to heart but then days later said, “this is just who I am.”  I've been working on ways to fix this; it just isn’t very successful.",0
1799,relationships,I will take my mom to therapy with me when our schedules work.,0
1800,relationships,**TONIGHT:**,0
1801,relationships,She’s so sweet and gentle such that a complete stranger can reach into her mouth and take food away and she won’t even react.,0
1802,relationships,But she sometimes tries to grab food off the table if people aren’t around.,0
1803,relationships,MIL has been with us for several months now and tells us she loves spending time with the baby.,0
1804,relationships,She has her own room.,0
1805,relationships,I cook all the meals and my wife does most of the laundry.,0
1806,relationships,"I went on a week long Mexico vacation with my BF of 5 months, and she tried to sit me down and have a conversation about how if I got pregnant I would ruin my life (I had to teach myself all about those things because she preferred to ignore it, it's a good thing I enjoy research).",0
1807,relationships,"Now that I've decided to move in with my BF when I move back to my hometown, I don't even know how or when I should bring this one up.",0
1808,relationships,A little information on my own thought process and my relationship.,0
1809,relationships,"I am a very pragmatic person, but also very independent.",0
1810,relationships,"They're all things I enjoy doing and don't see as being that big of a deal, but she seems to perceive them as grand gestures.",0
1811,relationships,"She regularly says that she ""doesn't deserve"" someone as ""perfect"" as me (which yes, she does, she's amazing, and also I'm not even that great, just moderately thoughtful) and has also said that ""because of past experiences, I have trouble liking people who I know like me...",0
1812,relationships,"I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've ""earned"" the validation.""",0
1813,relationships,"In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her).",0
1814,relationships,"All of this makes me ambivalent about broaching the topic of a committed relationship with her because I don't know how she'll react, but at this point we've both admitted we're falling for each other.",0
1815,relationships,"l asked if there was someone else and she said ""no, even if there was we weren't in a relationship"".",0
1816,relationships,"Fast forward 3 months and I'm finally over her and life is going great, then I got a text from her and we started talking again.",0
1817,relationships,"During the holidays I returned to my country and I spent all month with her, this time officially dating.",0
1818,relationships,"We always kept our relationship open, so we jokingly spoke about one night stands and if we had any during those 3 months apart.",0
1819,relationships,We both mentioned that we had one - after we stopped talking.,0
1820,relationships,She embarrass him in front of others.,0
1821,relationships,Last weekend was really what made me decide to write this.,0
1822,relationships,"Jay, Marie, me and the husband were at another couples house.",0
1823,relationships,We were drinking and playing board games but Jay had to work the next day so he stopped early.,0
1824,relationships,Marie starts taking this personally for some reason and then says to all of us that he’s “always ruining her nights out”.,0
1825,relationships,I’d like to be married before we are pregnant.,0
1826,relationships,I’m not willing to compromise on that.,0
1827,relationships,Anyone been in a similar situation?,0
1828,relationships,Advice on how to proceed?,0
1829,relationships,I'll try to keep this short and succint so it's easier to read.,0
1830,relationships,I had a very brief relationship with this girl.,0
1831,relationships,We both conected inmediately and tried to be in a relationship.,0
1832,relationships,We both had problems that consumed us: she was bulimic and I had erections issues; we both had parent issues and a nihilistic aproach to life.,0
1833,relationships,"I wasn't a (mentally) strong boy, I was very immature and naive, I suppose she was kind of the same.",0
1834,relationships,"Picked music up again and I'm considering the possibility of doing it for the rest of my life rather than science, which is what I've been led by my environment to believe is my ""destiny.""",0
1835,relationships,I think so.,0
1836,relationships,It’s like hes expecting my tummy is spilling over my jeans like a muffin(it’s not) I’m still a size small instead of an Xsmall like I used to be when 14 but that’s pretty fucking normal I reckon.its like god help me if I’m a medium right?,0
1837,relationships,"Today I lashed out at him by saying omg dad it’s cuz I’m wearing these pants today ( the pants which are wide, loos high waisted and make ass look bigger), instead of skinny jeans so I obv gained like 10 pounds or tonnes of kilos or whatever overnight.",0
1838,relationships,"Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle, it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me, he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore.",0
1839,relationships,Anyway this part isn’t relevant to my relationship but I’d like to share anyway.,0
1840,relationships,Clearly what i need to do is just talk to her about it.,0
1841,relationships,I have a couple of examples in mind that will drive the point home.,0
1842,relationships,Mainly the first night i was introduced to everyone and a house warming we went to.,0
1843,relationships,We're having dinner tomorrow night.,0
1844,relationships,Thanks a ton for the feedback everyone.,0
1845,relationships,Also deflects my attempts at flirting.,0
1846,relationships,"I have always told her that if there’s anything she wants to know, no matter how uncomfortable it may be, that I’d tell her I the truth and in return that she would do the same.",0
1847,relationships,I repeatedly gave warning that I didn’t think it would help and that it was a bad idea.,0
1848,relationships,She said she had to know and I told her that I would but she couldn’t turn it into an issue because this all happened before I even knew her.,0
1849,relationships,She agreed.,0
1850,relationships,"This week, we stayed in the same house and I slept with her.",0
1851,relationships,We were watching a movie when she went to go to sleep in the next room (she's very tired a lot).,0
1852,relationships,"About an hour later, I heard her crying uncontrollably and shaking and screaming.",0
1853,relationships,It was really hard to see.,0
1854,relationships,"I held her until she went back to sleep, and then stayed with her.",0
1855,relationships,We broke up a month ago because the distance made us miserable.,0
1856,relationships,"We had only been doing long distance for 3-ish months, which is not long at all, but we had been dating before that for roughly 3 years, with a short break in between.",0
1857,relationships,I'm taking a gap year so I've been bouncing from place to place & my parents are so protective that they don't let me visit friends at college often (especially not her since they are suspicious of our relationship anyway [homophobia lol]).,0
1858,relationships,"I did visit her once, but only for a few days and she visited me in return.",0
1859,relationships,"Anyway, we both couldn't commit to a strict schedule of meeting up because of school, parents, money...",0
1860,relationships,I went on a holiday with my best friend [26M] and husband [26M].,0
1861,relationships,My husband and I have been together for ten years (married for six).,0
1862,relationships,"My best friend and I have known each other for three years, and spend a huge amount of time chatting with each other on the internet.",0
1863,relationships,"I love him to death, and he makes me insanely happy.",0
1864,relationships,"My friend lives decently far away, so we don't see each other often.",0
1865,relationships,Meet with her today and express this is a concern for me.,0
1866,relationships,"She says she doesn't see what the big deal is, people make mistakes and forget things.",0
1867,relationships,I agree and tell her they often forget what they don't care about.,0
1868,relationships,"She doesn't agree, we talk about it.",0
1869,relationships,She feels I am being very black and white in my thinking.,0
1870,relationships,The gist of the comments received was the K isn't going to change and I should get B to go to counselling to help her with her self-esteem and give her some outside input.,0
1871,relationships,"Of course, now K is having an online ""role playing relationship"" with some lady on Grand Theft Auto RP.",0
1872,relationships,B is helping him court her.,0
1873,relationships,She is presenting it as she is okay with this.,0
1874,relationships,"Listen, I've known B since high school, I've known her longer then my brother.",0
1875,relationships,Haven't felt this excited about someone since my ex from over five months ago.,0
1876,relationships,"This guy, J, and I met on Bumble.",0
1877,relationships,"I haven't even met him yet, but we have spent hours chatting on the phone and laughing.",0
1878,relationships,It all feels really effortless.,0
1879,relationships,I've dated a lot since the break up and no one has clicked with me like he has.,0
1880,relationships,They actually skyped on New Years (mostly for the sake of his Grandmother (his father’s mother) who he has a positive relationship with but somehow they are friends??),0
1881,relationships,"Anyways--- **MY MOTHER:** My mother, is a self-proclaimed ""Jewish mother"".",0
1882,relationships,"She subscribes to all the stereotypes and upholds them, and is disgustingly proud of it.",0
1883,relationships,"I basically said the same back, because it's true.",0
1884,relationships,The following days and weeks we kept hanging out occasionally and stayed in touch when she wasnt at BF in other city.,0
1885,relationships,"Than randomly, out of nowhere, no response... Few days , weeks, and now about 2 months.",0
1886,relationships,I called texted for about the first 2 weeks to see what was going on.,0
1887,relationships,Than just stopped trying.,0
1888,relationships,"Sorry, this will probably be a little long.",0
1889,relationships,"So, I broke up with my boyfriend of over a year early last month, and it's been... rough.",0
1890,relationships,"Half the time, I don't even know why we broke up.",0
1891,relationships,I thought our breakup was mutual.,0
1892,relationships,"She told me she was excited, I was just more enthusiastic about it.",0
1893,relationships,"I let it go, and we went out with friends for new years.",0
1894,relationships,I still felt this distance.,0
1895,relationships,"New years morning we woke up, I rolled over and told her that I wanted 2018 to be the year we really focus on us, that I was excited to keep working on getting us to a good place.",0
1896,relationships,She didn't seem to care.,0
1897,relationships,So here’s he thing.,0
1898,relationships,I do have feelings for him.,0
1899,relationships,They just aren’t the intensity level I’m used to feeling when I fall for some one.,0
1900,relationships,I normally have this sense of urgency.,0
1901,relationships,Its this “Crazy about you/can’t live with out you” type feeling.,0
1902,relationships,"When she got angry she also insults me for that, that she can never forgive me that ive done this at this time.",0
1903,relationships,2 minutes later she apoligizes for saying that.,0
1904,relationships,"She also said that we may not be sexually compatible, and that its unfair on me if I stay with her and put up with it.",0
1905,relationships,I obviously told her I don't want to break up and she doesn't either.,0
1906,relationships,I offered her time alone and she was so unsure in herself that she didn't even know if she wanted to take me up on the offer.,0
1907,relationships,"I said that I think we should wait until your appointment in March to freeze your ectropion, to see if that improves your libido.",0
1908,relationships,We ended up crying and cuddling each other.,0
1909,relationships,We had a lot in common and I really liked her.,0
1910,relationships,Then I went back to my country for Christmas holidays and I got to see her.,0
1911,relationships,It was really amazing and honestly it was way better than we expected.,0
1912,relationships,"Anyway, she has good grades and she's going to apply to the US (probably the same university as mine or same city).",0
1913,relationships,But the problem is she will be there in fall 2019.,0
1914,relationships,"I'm 35,husband 37 I always thought it would be ideal to have two kids.. My husband was on board with the idea hypothetically but now that it's actually the time to execute he is totally opposed to the idea His reasons are 1) He feels we can't afford it...He earns pretty well but I don't at the time.",0
1915,relationships,So we won't be able to actually build up a major college fund for her---- I feel that she can always take a loan later but she really can't loan a sibling.,0
1916,relationships,"I am lazy, this I can attest to.",0
1917,relationships,"She brings up the Christmas tree, and how we haven't taken it down yet.",0
1918,relationships,"I just stand in silence from her barrage, then take a bite of my sandwich.",0
1919,relationships,I start to take off ornaments and lay them aside.,0
1920,relationships,"She starts to rummage around and escalate and point out things that we haven't done, getting progressively louder.",0
1921,relationships,He did not say much about it.,0
1922,relationships,I have Morgie's cell phone number.,0
1923,relationships,We aren't very close because I don't see her around much.,0
1924,relationships,I've only met her a couple of times before.,0
1925,relationships,Should I text her or call her and ask what happened that night?,0
1926,relationships,Need to make a move now or never Update: I texted her more about it and she forgot about what happened until I reminded her!,0
1927,relationships,"She said It’s not off the table, she just felt braver yesterday due to the liquid courage.",0
1928,relationships,"So I just asked if she wants to hang one last time, maybe go somewhere like we did last time and have a drink and listen to music.",0
1929,relationships,"I enjoy the life we've built together and think we've both grown a lot the past eight years, in positive ways.",0
1930,relationships,Thank you for reading and for any advice you may have.,0
1931,relationships,"--- TLDR: SO has two co-workers with romantic feelings for her, one of which I feel she emotionally cheated on me with.",0
1932,relationships,"I met this wonderful girl in November, and everything was going great, she was special enough that I let her meet my friends and family, and I met her siblings and mother as well.",0
1933,relationships,She had told me that she had this friend [M21] that she met online.,0
1934,relationships,"They have never met in person, but she said it was all strictly friendship and nothing else.",0
1935,relationships,She mentioned how she helped him get through suicide and that he was a really good person.,0
1936,relationships,"I told him if he’s not careful, all this attention could make her fall in love with him.",0
1937,relationships,"For a while, I noticed the behavior stopped.",0
1938,relationships,"He wouldn’t stay up as late, they stopped working out for a little bit, the glances and flirting stopped, and I noticed they weren’t talking as much, because they both talked to me more.",0
1939,relationships,"However, recently it has started back up again, and almost as strongly as before.",0
1940,relationships,"They do all the same things again, and they are always making eye contact with eachother or teasing and flirting.",0
1941,relationships,I really want to travel and it really is hard to find people to go with.,0
1942,relationships,I would love to go solo but I am sometimes fearful of asking my parents because I don't want them to convince me otherwise/tell me no.,0
1943,relationships,I have this huge wanderlust and I want to see the world and constantly learn.,0
1944,relationships,I did apply to a grad program with many global opportunities to fulfill the dream of mine and I am excited as well.,0
1945,relationships,I’m definitely keeping the child.,0
1946,relationships,We don’t own our house so will just go our separate ways.,0
1947,relationships,I’m totally open to him being part of the child’s life if he wants.,0
1948,relationships,I know he would be a good dad despite him turning out to be a terrible husband Thanks for the advice guys.,0
1949,relationships,"At times, he would get stalker-ish, and she would remove him from her contacts.",0
1950,relationships,"This would infuriate him, and he would create an alternate character to threaten her, saying how he is going to find her, kill her, and tell me about their relationship.",0
1951,relationships,"Being scared, my wife would add him back, pretend to be friends, only to repeat this cycle over several times over the next few years.",0
1952,relationships,"Yes, they somehow remained ""friends"" for years after this affair.",0
1953,relationships,The next stab came when I was sent to an Air Force base for a 3 month training for my job.,0
1954,relationships,"She'll order so much food, and binges on it, while downing shots the whole time.",0
1955,relationships,The way she orders food and drinks kinda makes me change my eating and drinking habits when I'm with her.,0
1956,relationships,It's like I'm binging too.,0
1957,relationships,She always excuses herself to the bathroom right after a meal and I know she's purging.,0
1958,relationships,"The more recent time I hung out with her, I put my foot down a little more and told her i didn't want to pay for so much food, and that I wasn't doing shots (I never do shots, but she always orders them for me when I'm out with her and then is really manipulative in order to pressure me to do them).",0
1959,relationships,Everything was absolutely perfect.,0
1960,relationships,"He is always very quiet, but is a complete sweetheart, and very warm and kind once he trusts someone.",0
1961,relationships,He’s pretty much the spitting image of what I imagined of the person I would marry when I was young.,0
1962,relationships,The one thing about him that would have seemed “off” is that he never really talked at all about his life before the Army.,0
1963,relationships,"I know what city he is from, and a couple inconsequential details, but nothing significant.",0
1964,relationships,My sister lives with her BF and my 2 year old nephew about 30 minutes away from me.,0
1965,relationships,A few days ago she asked if her and my nephew can come spend next Monday - Friday with me because her BF is going out of town and she doesn't want to be in the house alone without him (they live with his family so I guess sometimes it gets uncomfortable).,0
1966,relationships,I said okay sure.,0
1967,relationships,I live in 500 sqft a studio but I have a pullout couch in addition to my bed.,0
1968,relationships,I've been with my BF for 3 years and about 5 months ago he unofficially moved in with me (unofficial because we share bills and all of his stuff is here but his mail and whatnot still goes to his parents where he was living before).,0
1969,relationships,He doesnt seem bothered about calling me or meeting me unless I initiate.,0
1970,relationships,"We dont talk for very long as he still lives with his parents and is apparently always ""busy"" helping his mum.",0
1971,relationships,"Im mostly available, as I work part time as Im a student but I live in a rented shared flat.",0
1972,relationships,We seldom talk about the future.,0
1973,relationships,"I want to talk about the future, I planned to work abroad this year as I graduate soon but stopped those plans after meeting him as he is only in college and will take another 3 years until he finishes education.",0
1974,relationships,Which now leads me to where I am now.,0
1975,relationships,I had a talk with person A and she wants to get back together.,0
1976,relationships,Person B really wants a relationship with me.,0
1977,relationships,But I don’t really want my ex(person a) to go back and try to get into relationships and talk to all these guys.,0
1978,relationships,"I’ve been in the mood since Friday night, we had a date and when we got tired and I let her go to sleep.",0
1979,relationships,Saturday morning I tried doing some forplay and she stopped me and told me to wait till later that night and she would make it up to me.,0
1980,relationships,Saturday night rolls around and she just falls asleep.,0
1981,relationships,"Sunday morning I climb out of bed and start breakfast, and she said “Too bad you were asleep this morning, I tried to wake you up for something special...” Later that day we were getting ready for a birthday party, and she said, “I wish we could be undressing instead, but we got a party to go to...” I took that as a hint that later tonight she’ll finally be in the mood.",0
1982,relationships,"If she were honest or apologetic, I could try to understand.",0
1983,relationships,But is that naive?,0
1984,relationships,"I signed up for Facebook over the weekend, and Corrine was in my suggested people to add.",0
1985,relationships,Sorry this is so long!,0

2087,relationships,"Lisa was the only person in my inner circle of friends to have a poor reaction when I told her I was dating another woman, which was shocking to me because I trusted her, and because she often used social media to convey her allyship with the LGBT community.",0
2088,relationships,"She often told me that as soon as I met my gf, I quit talking to her (Lisa).",0
2089,relationships,"As my relationship with my gf became more serious, Lisa and I became even more distant from each other, and she would often ignore my texts or emails (neither of us were ever much for talking on the phone).",0
2090,relationships,"I don't feel at all like he doesn't like me or has gone off me, we meet once a week and 'chat' daily but I'm kind of unhappy I'm not getting the 'cant get enough of talking' experience that usually comes along with being enamoured at the start.",0
2091,relationships,"I nearly always reply within 20 mins if I'm not busy because I'm still in the excited pahse, but I get a lot of 3/4 wait times with a read receipt, with him coming on and off whatsapp within that period before I get a reply.",0

2128,relationships,We've been on 3 dates so far and he's great!,0
2129,relationships,"Funny, nice, understanding.",0
2130,relationships,Unfortunately I don't really feel a spark.,0
2131,relationships,I thought going on more than 1 date would let me see him as more than a friend but I have no desire to even kiss him even though I enjoy hanging out with him.,0
2132,relationships,"So when Markus asked me for a date night, just the two of us, I didn't hesitate.",0
2133,relationships,"I have loved this man so much, I think I still do.",0
2134,relationships,These date nights made us feel like we're young again.,0

2145,relationships,My wife (we've been together 8 years) however is determined to 'finish the job'.,0
2146,relationships,Her father taught her much of what she knows and that is certainly a factor as to why she is an constructual engineer...,0
2147,relationships,But unlike her father she isn't a certified electrician or plumber nor is she especially skilled at carpentry.,0
2148,relationships,"The issue is that we live 5 hours away and even if we did go *every* weekend to work on the house it would take well over a year to even get it into a acceptable state, let alone 'finished' and sellable.",0
2149,relationships,I brought up the idea of getting contractors to finish the house.,0
2150,relationships,"She was unemployed and toyed with the idea of answering ads from strangers to perform fetish tasks for money, to include nudity (but no sex).",0
2151,relationships,It really wrecked me that she would consider that.,0
2152,relationships,She brought it up once again not too long ago (not seriously) and I flipped out.,0
2153,relationships,She was working as a nanny for a long time and I was very insecure about her and her boss because of my fear that she would be willing to do sex work for money.,0
2154,relationships,"Now, she has never done any sex work for money and we agreed that it is not something I am comfortable with and she will not do it, so that's not an issue.",0
2155,relationships,All that.,0
2156,relationships,When we're not together in the evenings we talk through messages.,0
2157,relationships,"She is that attentive that it makes me tired, I have to write everything in a long single message with line breaks otherwise as soon as I start messaging she starts replying.",0
2158,relationships,I feel like I can be that person for my girlfriend since I love her but I don't think I want to sacrifice my happiness for that.,0
2159,relationships,I just want to have a simple life and find someone who will have time for me.,0
2160,relationships,I didn't grow up in a loving family like her.,0
2161,relationships,It's not always about money.,0

2170,relationships,"However, since that hour had passed, her boyfriend refused to stay any longer and made both of them go home, even though she really wanted to go on the boat.",0
2171,relationships,"These are some of the bigger events that have pissed me off; however, they have the same fight everyday regarding their differing values, and her wanting to do things/live her life and him refusing to make any sort of sacrifice or compromise to do that with her, resulting in her just settling to the situation.",0
2172,relationships,"Since graduation, he accepted that crappy job and moved across the country, taking her with him.",0
2173,relationships,"Hey everyone, throwaway for personal reasons.",0
2174,relationships,Tonight my girlfriend met her lady friend she didn't see for a year.,0

2184,relationships,At the time of this post it has been 7 years on going and had faced innumerous delays.,0
2185,relationships,"The biggest restrictions was of course money, my father-in-law refused to get any contractors, in the belief they were too expensive and wouldn't do the job to the standard he wanted, he also sourced all the materials from back yard sales and contacts.",0
2186,relationships,I dont want to break up because other than this one issue he is a wonderful partner and I really enjoy my time with him.,0

2206,relationships,Being around her lit a fire in me again - I wanted to be a better man because of her.,0
2207,relationships,"I was sweet to her but not overly so, her son was with his dad for Christmas and I sent her flowers since I knew she was feeling down.",0
2208,relationships,She called me the next day and was so grateful and loved them.,0
2209,relationships,I was complementary of her and she ate it up and asked me in a non-guilty (more of an “I love how you are to me” way) why I’m so sweet to her.,0
2210,relationships,I work with her sister.,0
2211,relationships,Her sister got me this great job at our firm after I was introduced through a mutual friend and hit it off.,0

2214,relationships,"Her sister is charming, personable, but also the most vindictive person I've ever seen.",0

2216,relationships,"A few months after starting classes, my buddy told me that Chloe has a  crush on me, and gave me the impression that she wanted me to be aware of this, however, even after that, she didn’t try to talk to me or make herself noticed at all.",0

2232,relationships,We were planing to move before Christmas but I put all on hold for her thesis so she could focus on that.,0
2233,relationships,She said plenty of times that my apartment was a big issue for her because it was so small and that when we moved to her parent's 2nd house we would have a great improvement in our relationship and our life.,0
2234,relationships,"And enjoy this day of the miracle that is being above-ground, breathing the air, and feeling the world around you.",0
2235,relationships,"If anything like this has happened (or is happening) to you, know that there's at least one guy out there who can relate.",0
2236,relationships,Time tends to heal all wounds.,0
2237,relationships,I guess I'll go take my kid for a walk.,0
2238,relationships,However 4 months ago I moved to a different country for education.,0
2239,relationships,"We met a handful number of times before I left and they weren’t dates exactly, just as best friends.",0
2240,relationships,After I got here (foreign country) we have been speaking almost daily on the phone and gotten even more closer.,0
2241,relationships,We recently started dropping hints to each other that we like each other and finally decided to discuss what we feel.,0
2242,relationships,She told me she loves me and wants a relationship.,0
2243,relationships,I have to first start off by saying my voice is not high-pitched.,0
2244,relationships,"My inflection occasionally goes up, especially if I'm excited about something.",0
2245,relationships,"I'm sort of expressive with my hands while talking, though I don't think more than anyone else, male or female.",0
2246,relationships,She tells me this is the only thing that is making her doubt our relationship.,0
2247,relationships,A little background: this has been an issue with her for her last several boyfriends.,0
2248,relationships,(I really did).,0
2249,relationships,"If she needed space to do homework, thats perfectly fine.",0
2250,relationships,I did my best to assuage her anxiety.,0
2251,relationships,"So we'd postpone another week, another day... only, either the night before or the morning of, she'd cancel me visiting again... again.. and again... That put a little strain on our relationship, we wanted to see each other.",0
2252,relationships,"I have no problem with a few years either way, hell the last girl I dated was 6 years younger, but this is an entire decade.",0
2253,relationships,That's a lot.,0
2254,relationships,But other than the number itself I don't know if I should care this much or not.,0
2255,relationships,She's pretty mature for her age and I'm admitedly a bit of a late bloomer so we are in roughly the same stage of life so that's not an issue like in a lot of age differential cases.,0
2256,relationships,She never really felt the need to do that and occasionally would go out with her friends.,0
2257,relationships,"Everything was great -- I took care of her extremely well, she took care of me patiently and amazingly.",0
2258,relationships,"I bought her a car, paid for her rent, and ultimately supported her so she could focus and finish her college (I'm full time employed, the breadwinner in the relationship).",0
2259,relationships,Our relationship was VIVID and full of color in the beginning.,0
2260,relationships,"We had our own apartment, got a beautiful dog together, and traveled to a few places.",0
2261,relationships,"Many of my cohorts asked me ""how are you two even friends?""",0
2262,relationships,when he came to which I couldn't give a clear answer.,0
2263,relationships,"So in short, we have a business license and agreement we both signed.",0
2264,relationships,"We were friends, but I think time has changed him and I and I don't think we would be friends if we met today.",0
2265,relationships,"He isn't productive for the business and his practices many times seems to include emotion and his own self interests rather than the business, so I find him unfit as a business partner as well.",0
2266,relationships,She works 6 days a week and usually ends her work day around 9-10pm.,0
2267,relationships,I work from 9-5pm.,0
2268,relationships,"She lives across the city, 45 minutes away from me.",0
2269,relationships,"When she works, we can hardly meet.",0
2270,relationships,"So when we do make plans to meet, I extremely value those time.",0
2271,relationships,I realized that maybe it's better if we break up even though I love him so much and he's one of the most important people in my life.,0
2272,relationships,"If we werent together for so long, I'd probably would've just blocked him already and carry on.",0
2273,relationships,But I don't want that.,0
2274,relationships,I want to keep being friends.,0
2275,relationships,**Tl;dr: Thinking my 2 friends who broke-up are soulmates but may be both heading for a second-best option.,0
2276,relationships,"** Very long post, please read only if you are interested in complicated realtionships and take it maybe as a short novel.",0
2277,relationships,"I have 2 friends who got together when 19, they were inseparable, instant soulmates, I know they imagined their whole life together almost immediately, never even thinking they can break-up.",0
2278,relationships,"For 10 years, they were the best couple I know, not fighting, respecting each other greatly and having a ""higher"" connection.",0
2279,relationships,"Hey, I (m, 18) don't know, what I should do, about my brother.",0
2280,relationships,"Apart from many different things that are bothering me about him this one is at the moment a big problem, because I often have people here at my house: He doesn't clean the bathroom, which means he doesn't flush the toilet, pees on the ground, leaves sometimes condoms laying around etc.",0
2281,relationships,Sometimes one a week on the weekend.,0
2282,relationships,This worked greated.,0
2283,relationships,Until late june.,0
2284,relationships,She started to cancel my visits to see her.,0
2285,relationships,"Asking if I was mad, when I constantly told her I supported everything she needed to do to succeed.",0
2286,relationships,I tried to reply to most but I think I'd like to forget about this post for a bit and move on.,0
2287,relationships,So I'm going to stop replying.,0
2288,relationships,"If there is advice or information that someone hasn't given me yet and you think would be helpful, please feel free to private message me.",0
2289,relationships,I'm planning to go to the wedding.,0
2290,relationships,I will not be going out of my way to help with the wedding.,0
2291,relationships,Any advice is appreciated!,0
2292,relationships,"TL;DR: Have been on 3 first dates over the last few months, and each I thought went well or above and beyond well, but each of them haven't wanted to go on a second date with me.",0
2293,relationships,IDK.,0
2294,relationships,I've applied to anything I can think of and have had no luck.,0
2295,relationships,"And for the people who implied I have no ""market value"" to him, my divorce was because my ex cheated.",0
2296,relationships,"Plus, we’re using his car, which will eventually result in the usual wear and tear and expenses.",0
2297,relationships,"We equally split all shared expenses like gas, food, rent, and bills, but we both have the same salary and similar assets.",0
2298,relationships,"Do any cohabiting couples pool and split their commuting expenses equally, or do you just chalk it up to a difference in individual expenses and each pay your own way?",0
2299,relationships,tl;dr : My boyfriend's commute is twice as expensive as mine and it doesn't really seem fair.,0
2300,relationships,Should we split it?,0
2301,relationships,We set our wedding date last August for July 15th.,0
2302,relationships,We specifically picked this date after looking at the average temperatures for that date for the last 5 years.,0
2303,relationships,"We determined the highs were about 7 degrees cooler than the following weekends in July, so we went with the 15th.",0
2304,relationships,"Wouldn’t you know it, but my FMIL booked their family vacation for July.",0
2305,relationships,One night after going to a club we go back to our friends and we snuggle next to each other.,0
2306,relationships,She interlocks her fingers into my hand and later on in the night turns around and kisses me.,0
2307,relationships,We kiss for the whole night.,0
2308,relationships,We couldn't do anything more because our friends were sleeping in the same room.,0
2309,relationships,We didn't talk about that night until a few weeks later when we went to a bar together.,0
2310,relationships,"Since then I´ve met some ""wrong ones""- I mean guys who lied to me, for example this guy who was trying to convince me that he loves me and wants only me and I found out that he´s been dating a girl since 2014 and that they´re expecting a baby.",0
2311,relationships,"So yeah after these few ""mistakes"", I started having trust issues.",0
2312,relationships,"I just couldn´t trust guys, every time I met someone I couldn´t trust him and couldn´t stop expecting something bad coming.",0
2313,relationships,In December last year the best thing in my life happened to me.,0
2314,relationships,"I´ve met a guy, and he´s #EverythingGoals.",0
2315,relationships,So we were talking about it and she wouldn't budge again.,0
2316,relationships,"The conversation started to heat up, nothing I said was enough, that we would buy something, that I would cook with her, that we could go 1 day earlier and cook at my grandma's, nothing.",0
2317,relationships,She pushed me to the edge again until I lost it and ended the argue saying that she mustn't go this year with me.,0
2318,relationships,"That she must stay with her family, that I didn't want her to go with my family so she wouldn't have to worry anymore.",0
2319,relationships,She calmed down and we got to sleep.,0
2320,relationships,* Is this a lack of clear communication?,0
2321,relationships,(By either one party or both) * Should I try to get back in touch with them?,0
2322,relationships,Thank you if you made it this far.,0
2323,relationships,"Through my interactions with him, I have gotten the hint that Jack is interested in me, in a more-than-friends kind of way.",0
2324,relationships,I don't want to assume this as a fact—it's certainly possible that he is just trying to make a new friend.,0
2325,relationships,"Along with many small hints that he *is* interested in me, however, the biggest hint is probably whenever I mention my boyfriend.",0
2326,relationships,"I have a boyfriend of about a year, and whenever I do mention him, Jack seems very visibly uncomfortable.",0
2327,relationships,Good goals - She finished undergrad and already wants to go back to school.,0
2328,relationships,I value girls who want to get a good education or pursue entrepreneurship.,0
2329,relationships,"Doesn't ask me for much - Given my financial situation, she hasn't asked me to do something that was out of my budget.",0
2330,relationships,I'm asking this because most of the girls I've met aren't like her.,0
2331,relationships,I will not be sharing my credit details.,0
2332,relationships,"Though hard, I will end my friendship with her.",0
2333,relationships,Might think about it if she apologizes but am not sure at this moment.,0
2334,relationships,I will cherish connections with more on my other friends who were super nice to let me know what's happening at home.,0
2335,relationships,"So the now: we had been commiserating for a while about our shitty exes and stress, and about 3 weeks ago I was on a date and realized I would have rather just spent the night with her instead of the date.",0
2336,relationships,A couple days later while having some drinks and de-stressing I kissed her.,0
2337,relationships,She kissed me back.,0
2338,relationships,"We stopped before having sex and ended up meeting a couple days later where we both agreed to take things slow, in light of our most recent breakups.",0
2339,relationships,We ended up spending the next few nights together as she didn't want to be home around her ex and we just cuddled and would kiss but then stop before we had sex.,0
2340,relationships,And we end up spending an indefinitely long period of time together that just never seems like it will end.,0
2341,relationships,"I would really like to be able to hang out with her, like cook dinner, or go to a bar, or watch a movie, for example, and then just both go back to our individual homes and do our own thing.",0
2342,relationships,"But, that seems impossible.",0
2343,relationships,"I guess I’m really if it is necessary to constantly, physically, be with a S/O for a healthy relatioship to flourish?",0
2344,relationships,"I was home for winter break, and I didn't see him at all during that time.",0
2345,relationships,"To clarify, I'm a goodie-two-shoes.",0
2346,relationships,"I never did anything ""bad"" until I was in my early teens.",0
2347,relationships,Be ready to contribute (reasonably).,0
2348,relationships,"B - Calmly, with neutral to negative vocabulary and intonation express dissatisfaction with certain behavior, action or outcome of action and politely ask not to repeat same behavior/action/make sure particular outcome doesn’t repeat again.",0
2349,relationships,Make sure message was audible and comprehended and if necessary still calmly repeat again Be ready for calm reasonable discussion in case of decline.,0
2350,relationships,"C - Harsh, sudden, loud expression of dissatisfaction.",0
2351,relationships,I suggested therapy but he's not in favour of it.,0
2352,relationships,"I think his father passing has also altered his reactions, which are out of whack now.",0
2353,relationships,"I was sick last week and was not in town - he let a couple of dishes fester in the sink, and I discovered when I got back that there was fungus on it.",0
2354,relationships,"When I'm single it's never an issue if a person I'm seeing is sleeping with others but as soon as I fall in love, I can get kind of possessive.",0
2355,relationships,My partner is very much the opposite.,0
2356,relationships,All of his relationships have been open and he's slept with pretty much all of his friends.,0
2357,relationships,Maybe a few months ago he told me that he'd really like it if I slept with other people.,0
2358,relationships,I was fairly keen but was getting weird gut fear at the thought of him sleeping with other people.,0
2359,relationships,"We kept in touch the entire time (and he'd always seem to want me desperately, even telling me things like ""I can't wait to see you as soon as I'm back"").",0
2360,relationships,"But when he got back, he didn't see me right away.",0
2361,relationships,"And despite my asking him a couple of times (like, two or three), we didn't see each other for nearly two months.",0
2362,relationships,"Eventually, I literally said ""So are we ever going to see each other again or is this just over?""",0
2363,relationships,"He responded by immediately asking me on a date for that week, at a nice French restaurant near his place.",0
2364,relationships,I could really use additional input on this because I'm not exactly sure what a healthy and compatible relationship looks like at this point.,0
2365,relationships,"When we try to go out and do things, we often do not have fun because our personalities clash.",0
2366,relationships,"Example of this, I wanted to go kayaking and was surprised that he said yes because he rarely wants to be outside.",0
2367,relationships,We get to the springs to kayak and I want to go in the water because I see no point in kayaking if you don't go in the water.,0
2368,relationships,He refuses because he hates water.,0
2369,relationships,Joe and Janet live in the big city a few hours away from the small town where they grew up.,0
2370,relationships,They came here for university and stayed.,0
2371,relationships,About half of Joe’s circle of friends is Janet’s friend circle including ex boyfriends and her college peers.,0
2372,relationships,The other half are bar friends.,0
2373,relationships,"And I also know this is not what my grandmother would have wanted (she was very traditional, and having her granddaughters as pallbearers would just be not her style).",0
2374,relationships,"Personally, I have nothing against changing traditions- I just can't do it.",0
2375,relationships,"On top of it, I was not asked if I would be a pallbearer, I just found out via my sister that I would be one.",0
2376,relationships,My Dad was planning on telling me when I got there for the visitation.,0
2377,relationships,Reactions form my family have been:,0
2378,relationships,"However, he seems to have quite few girl-friends and he is friendly with them, but not to this extend I would say.",0
2379,relationships,We have known each other for a month now and I wonder should I wait for him to make a move / should I completely leave it since he is coworker / or should I ask him out?,0
2380,relationships,"I am interested to get to know him and I dont have problem to ask him out casually, however, I dont want to rush things.",0
2381,relationships,"On the other hand, I dont want it to get too old and have lots of small talk and not really get to know each other.",0
2382,relationships,My husband (29m) and I (26f) live across the country from our parents and have been there almost two years now.,0
2383,relationships,"I don't really have a relationship with my inlaws (mf 65ish) (ie they never reach out to me expect for once to ask what to get my husband for his birthday and rarely talk to my husband, they don't ask about me or don't seem interest when I'm brought up) and it doesn't bug me because they are incredibly negative and angry people.",0
2384,relationships,"I don't want to get into every story, and man do I have some stories, but i guess it's important to know that I've been warned about their general attitude and behavior from others and everyone who has met them that I'm friends or family with has agreed with me that their son is the source of their happiness and they feed off of each others negativity.",0
2385,relationships,"However, they've never been out rightly malicious towards me.",0
2386,relationships,I got a fair amount of interest on Facebook (though og course a lot of people didn’t follow through) one lady (F 40’s or early 50’s) liked my post and sent a friend request.,0
2387,relationships,I accepted even though I don’t know her because I thought she might be interested in the team.,0
2388,relationships,It turns out she is very well connected in the horse word here and knows a lot of people I know (and seems very popular).,0
2389,relationships,"Well, fast forward to now and this woman has posted all over about her starting an adult drill team.",0
2390,relationships,"Her team is within 20 minutes of where my drill team would be, and so all the people who were interested in mine seem to have gone to hers (I think because she’s a connected horse person here).",0
2391,relationships,I'm dating her for more than one year now and everything seems fine.,0
2392,relationships,"She's loving, she's caring and so am I. I know she truly loves me and I also loves her.",0
2393,relationships,"However, although all of this, some thoughts keep coming at me.",0
2394,relationships,I'll try to focus on these problems below in a objective manner.,0
2395,relationships,**The I want to see other girls problem**.,0
2396,relationships,"Sports teams, mostly, and some TV shows.",0
2397,relationships,He also enjoys a wide range of video games.,0
2398,relationships,"The problem is that I really, truly don't have anything in common with him.",0
2399,relationships,"I don't know shit about sports, I'm not really much of a TV-watcher and I'm not a huge gamer at all.",0
2400,relationships,I have some favorite shows but none of them are really that similar to those that Jack likes.,0
2401,relationships,Two years ago we moved to a different city for his work.,0
2402,relationships,"He earns a lot more than me and his job offers a lot more career progression, so I wanted to support him.",0
2403,relationships,"I’ve always thought we were a good team, there have been times where he’s struggled financially and I’ve helped him out no question.",0
2404,relationships,"We talked about the extra money he’d be able to save by walking to work (2 mins away,) and it seemed as though we were on the same page for what we wanted in the future; buy our own place, a car and start a family.",0
2405,relationships,So I thought all was on the right track.,0
2406,relationships,"They have two children together, Anna and a planned child, Grace.",0
2407,relationships,My uncle has 5 other children with 3 other women.,0
2408,relationships,"Grace is two years old, and I used to watch both Grace and Anna.",0
2409,relationships,"When Grace was born, my family was careful to give Anna more attention.",0
2410,relationships,"Anna is extremely, extremely obsessed with her little sister.",0
2411,relationships,"Then, the issue was that she was too dehydrated for a blood draw and the mental health hospital wouldn't take her without the draw.",0
2412,relationships,"So, I had to take her home and pump her full of water and food and cross our fingers that she could get a draw in the morning.",0
2413,relationships,"By morning, the bed had filled.",0
2414,relationships,"So, the counselor and I took her to the Emergency room to see if they could admit her at the local hospital.",0
2415,relationships,"There, she absolutely *refused* to have her blood drawn and the ER told me that they were just going to have to discharge her if they couldn't get the tests.",0
2416,relationships,"That night wasn’t so great for me as I felt ignored because both of the guys (my bf and the mutual friend) were mostly having conversations with her, leaving me to trail behind.",0
2417,relationships,"I thought maybe it’s because we were “hosting” her and because she’s on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to us - as in, she’s into things and engages in those things we’re not necessarily into, but are interested in and could hold a conversation about.",0
2418,relationships,"Anyway, over the course of our relationship my bf would still bring Sally up occasionally, how they were going to hang out with other coworkers.",0
2419,relationships,"Of course, I’m totally okay with that and I encourage him to be social when he can!",0
2420,relationships,"I’ve met all of his friends and I always enjoy myself around them - except you know who, enter Sally *rolls eyes*.",0
2421,relationships,**tl;dr friend is struggling with alcoholism and bulimia.,0
2422,relationships,She's back in town and wants to hang out and eat and drink.,0
2423,relationships,How do I tell her that I will no longer participate in these activities with Her?,0
2424,relationships,I heard from a mutual friend that she got engaged and I’m truly happy for her and would like to wish her congratulations.,0
2425,relationships,Is it is selfish of me to apologize to her and say congrats or just wish her congrats?,0
2426,relationships,Additional info: my sister was also her BFF and after I ghosted her they had a huge dramatic falling out after my sister tried to keep the peace.,0
2427,relationships,"I don't think it would be different in another relationship, and I think both of us accept that we have sexual hangups.",0
2428,relationships,But I always wonder if I would be more sexually passionate in a different relationship.,0
2429,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Do men just inherently look at the greener grass, or does a good relationship make you feel settled and satisfied?",0
2430,relationships,"And please don't say ""open relationship"" as the answer...",0
2431,relationships,"OK, so as the title says my sister has been trying to set me up with her friend for a couple of months now.",0
2432,relationships,Up til recently I refused to even entertain the idea because she is slightly over a full decade younger than me.,0
2433,relationships,"My sister thinks I'm being stupid letting the age difference make my mind up for me, to the point where we had a huge fight at Christmas about it but I refused to budge.",0
2434,relationships,"Recently however she's been bringing her friend around a lot (me, my sister, and her husband all get along really well so we hang out at least 2 or 3 weekends a month usually) and as I get to know this girl I am realizing why my sister has been so adamant about it.",0
2435,relationships,It's almost eerie how much we have in common.,0
2436,relationships,Though we both had crushes on each other we weren't sure if the feelings were reciprocated.,0
2437,relationships,"She also has some self esteem issues and told me that she wasn't ready to date someone like me three years ago when we first met, because I was ""too intimidating"", but instead ""settled"" for her ex.",0
2438,relationships,"She dated that ex for two years, but never seemed that interested in him.",0
2439,relationships,She would complain about feeling like a caregiver for him (he was seriously depressed to the point where she had to make doctor appointments for him) and always talked about wanting to be with someone who was more independent and had their life together.,0
2440,relationships,"As her friend I remember her saying she felt like he was good for her at the moment, but that she knew it wouldn't last forever (side note: she was open about her feelings with him, and he agreed to just enjoy things in the moment, though I'm sure he was secretly hopeful she would change her mind).",0
2441,relationships,I'm going to keep this story short.,0
2442,relationships,"I'm (16M) openly gay, he (16M) isn't.",0
2443,relationships,We've been friends and somewhat more for 5 months.,0
2444,relationships,"He hates affection and being touched, but he constantly flirts with me, touches me, wants me to massage his ""sore"" back, wants me to sleep beside him, he cuddles me in his ""sleep""(which he has now revealed to be a fake slumber), and he always asks me about being gay and he truly is trying to understand it.",0
2445,relationships,"Even if anything really happened between us, I wouldn't be getting a fulfilling relationship.",0
2446,relationships,"Back to my dad, during lunch he wanted to say some words to my GF, to encourage her to keep studying the doctorate, he said that if she felt that money was an issue, that don't let her that take her down, that doctorates in our country earn very poorly but that getting that degree would open doors to work abroad and land a job she would love.",0
2447,relationships,"You see, my dad didn't know (well, I've told him plenty of times, but I figured he forgot at the time) that my GF's mom was a doctorate.",0
2448,relationships,"My GF's mom openly told in front of my that she didn't earn enough for the years of study and work she did, everybody in our country knows that doctorates don't earn enough money for the effort, capacity and dedication they're required to do/have.",0
2449,relationships,"But when my dad said those words, nobody said anything.",0
2450,relationships,I didn't take it as offensive.,0
2451,relationships,"Been together for 5 years, married for 1 year.",0
2452,relationships,My husband outwardly reserved/introverted but he's also very goofy around me.,0
2453,relationships,We joke around and are playful with each other in most interactions unless it comes to serious subjects.,0
2454,relationships,"Lots of teasing, tickling, and 'play wrestling' in our home.",0
2455,relationships,"The problem has always been when it comes to, umm, being romantic.",0
2456,relationships,So I met this guy about 9 months ago at a meet-up group.,0
2457,relationships,We used to go out for drinks every other weekend and he'd always come on to me.,0
2458,relationships,We ended up hooking up a few times when drunk and became sort-of friends w/ benefits.,0
2459,relationships,It was the first time I'd done anything like that but he seemed like a natural flirter.,0
2460,relationships,"But after a while, some personal stuff got in the way of his life and he took a break from the drinking/partying etc.",0
2461,relationships,I want to start off by saying I love my in laws.,0
2462,relationships,They do a LOT for us and we are incredibly grateful for them.,0
2463,relationships,"My MIL has always been around to babysit when I’ve needed to go to doctors appts, and seeing that she has MS (not severe), my SIL comes over to help play/do the lifting.",0
2464,relationships,"My mil is capable of all of that, but she has a harder time.",0
2465,relationships,We have a history with my SIL.,0
2466,relationships,We went from completely being strangers to being absolutely the best of friends.,0
2467,relationships,"And im talking about a person who says the same things at the same time, perfectly understands your point, same faith, same songs you listen to, just so much coincidence happening during those 8 months that made me believe in fate, destiny - whatever you call it.",0
2468,relationships,"And im 28, i've had 2 exes.",0
2469,relationships,Both long term.,0
2470,relationships,Ive never been single since I was 17.,0
2471,relationships,"We met and it went really well - he's a super sweet, smart, and thoughtful kid (just like his dad).",0
2472,relationships,"It turns out that the kid has (VERY recently - after I met his dad) been dealing with some mental health issues - he texted a friend that he was suicidal, and his parents have been scrambling to get him help because they are not sure if he has depression or something else.",0
2473,relationships,He's since started therapy and seems to be doing ok but obviously they are very concerned.,0
2474,relationships,I listened and was very supportive when he told me (I've dealt with my fair share of mentally ill family members) and I could tell he really appreciated it.,0
2475,relationships,We talked about it a few more times after that day.,0
2476,relationships,I moved out of our family home and in with my boyfriend nearly 2 years ago.,0
2477,relationships,"Since then we’d speak a bit over text, mainly for each others birthdays.",0
2478,relationships,Last time we spoke via text was about three months ago.,0
2479,relationships,I asked Eva if she wanted tickets to a concert for a band that we both really like and had seen in concert together before.,0
2480,relationships,"She said yeah, but was less than enthusiastic when I gave her the ticket a week later when I went to visit.",0
2481,relationships,I've been dating this guy for nearly three months.,0
2482,relationships,"We met at a bar and had a one night stand, so my expectations were very low.",0
2483,relationships,We started by taking it slow (dinner or takeout and a movie on Saturdays) but things felt really nice and normal.,0
2484,relationships,I'm used to meeting guys on apps where everything is a game and usually they are dating multiple people at once; this felt different.,0
2485,relationships,We met before Thanksgiving and managed to keep the momentum going through a lot of travel and three weeks spent apart.,0
2486,relationships,As someone in there house is no longer going to be living with them as a mutual agreement.,0
2487,relationships,I get along really well with some people in this agreed group and they are far more enthusiastic and keen than the others I mentioned above.,0
2488,relationships,I discussed with this group prior to the free slot that it would be lovely to live with them if possible and now that they have a slot it's actually possible.,0
2489,relationships,Since that happened I agreed to live take the slot with them.,0
2490,relationships,Having a house with them (five of us total) and I think it's in my best interest as they are a tight friend group meaning communication to sort it out is easier and they're more assertive - four of them are also taking the same subject as me.,0
2491,relationships,"I meet a great guy, we connect immediately due to same interests.",0
2492,relationships,"I like him a lot, he likes me too.",0
2493,relationships,"We go on a few dates, everything goes smoothly - the conversation is still heated, the guy still shows enthusiasm regarding going out with me or me in general.",0
2494,relationships,"After a few dates, we end up either having sex or doing something sexual, and then it all cools down.",0
2495,relationships,The conversations go at a much slower pace up to the point where we stop talking at all.,0
2496,relationships,Neither did I.,0
2497,relationships,"This turned to weeks, months and before I knew it it was a year.",0
2498,relationships,I was bitter.,0
2499,relationships,I never received an apology and felt no consideration for my feelings regarding anything was there.,0
2500,relationships,I get confused sometimes as to why in my teen years I was okay with talking to her.,0
2501,relationships,She's okay if you say a rude joke back though so she can take it too.,0
2502,relationships,"She pokes fun at my lifestyle (I count calories by weighing things in grams, get my eyebrows waxed, go to the gym 5 days a week and jogging 1 day no matter the weather).",0
2503,relationships,"She is also way ahead in school, and will have a bachelor's at 19 from her university, while I am in my freshman year.",0
2504,relationships,"She also has a job in her field this year, she makes like $17 an hour and I work at a grocery store barely getting through freshman year while she's killing her senior classes.",0
2505,relationships,During our conversation about weird way girls have hit on me I asked about her and she listed way more weird guys than I had weird girls and I know she's hot and I know currently she has multiple offers to go Netflix and chill or go out (I've seen her open snapchats from these boys like over her shoulder while we've been hanging out).,0
2506,relationships,"Does he actually like me, or am I going to end up just hanging out with this guy?",0
2507,relationships,"He hasn't made a move yet, so I'm inclined to think the latter.",0
2508,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: I end up in confusing friendships with men that blur the lines between ""relationship"" and ""friendship.""",0
2509,relationships,"No we do not have sex everyday, yes we both work, no its not a problem of the change.",0
2510,relationships,"I should have said ""I'm usually successful 1 out of 4 times I attempt to initiate.""",0
2511,relationships,I just want to make sure that I am still crossing my i's and dotting my t's on my end or if I should ask her if there's any improvements I could make.,0
2512,relationships,---   **tl;dr**: Do most relationships die down in the bedroom after a while?,0
2513,relationships,"I mean that type of behavior is just weird, I don't understand how someone can still hang out with their friends every day almost like theyre in high school.",0
2514,relationships,His job is kind of low demand (bartender and has an internship at an office) so i guess he just has a lot of free time... but still.,0
2515,relationships,---   **tl;dr**: Boyfriend hangs out with his friends constantly and im worried this is a sign of immaturity.,0
2516,relationships,I had an anxiety attack.,0
2517,relationships,"When we returned home, I put my foot down.",0
2518,relationships,"I told him that his behavior towards me was unacceptable; above all, as my (then future) husband, he needed to put my comfort and well-being above all other considerations as I did with him.",0
2519,relationships,"He listening, apologized profusely, and we have not had any further issues with this.",0
2520,relationships,Until today.,0
2521,relationships,"So I pursued him, invited him to come out drinking with our friend group a couple times and slept with him early on.",0
2522,relationships,We continued sleeping with each other and I guess fell into a FWB situation (though he wanted us to be exclusive and we were).,0
2523,relationships,In the beginning it was mostly us going out to bars and me coming to his house to have sex.,0
2524,relationships,"We got on really well and it wasn't just a sex thing, but it seemed like it wasn't going to turn into a relationship and I was fine with that.",0
2525,relationships,Mostly because he didn't seem really concerned with it.,0
2526,relationships,A few weeks ago I found some notes of hers open at our computer.,0
2527,relationships,She had written questions to ask for a psychic reading or some such(she's into that stuff).,0
2528,relationships,"One of them was, ""is this guy worth pursuing?""",0
2529,relationships,"""This guy"" refers to an online friend from out of state she had been having extensive conversations with, which we had talked about not long before, and of course she labeled him as ""just a friend"", albeit him growing more and more fascinated with her.",0
2530,relationships,"I offered an open relationship, partly because I had entertained the idea before, but mostly to de-escalate what could be a relationship ending event.",0
2531,relationships,"He wasn't ambitious or motivated anymore, he was sad, depressed, always pessimistic and never really doing any work.",0
2532,relationships,"I ended up not only doing all development work, but also our social, PR and leg work as well here in NYC making relationships.",0
2533,relationships,Many times he has decided to hinder the business due to reasons related to what I mentioned.,0
2534,relationships,"For instance, one time we were creating an ad for a campaign we were running for the app.",0
2535,relationships,So I tried posting a similar post last week and had technical difficulties so here it goes.,0
2536,relationships,I think I’m going to do this chronologically— High school: I become close to someone who will become known as one of my best friends.,0
2537,relationships,Let’s call her Jessie.,0
2538,relationships,"I want to pursue a friendship because Jessie is a strong independent woman mature beyond her years, has a sassy Latina attitude, and we have the same sense of humor.",0
2539,relationships,"We've known each other for 9 years, were FWB for about 3 years, then moved into the committed monogamous relationship we're in now, and have been in for 2 years.",0
2540,relationships,"I've really enjoyed everything about our relationship, as she's taught me more than anyone ever has, and has been the best at putting up with any and all things that have come up.",0
2541,relationships,"About halfway through the first year, she began asking if I'd ever be okay with her experimenting with a girl, or if I'd ever consider her having other sex friends.",0
2542,relationships,"She doesn't want serious relationships with them, she only wants to bang.",0
2543,relationships,"Having never been asked that in any of my previous relationships, I told her I wasn't sure and that were I ever 100% on board with that idea, I'd let her know.",0
2544,relationships,She used the money from her moms house to buy her own.,0
2545,relationships,"That was a couple weeks in a hotel, but we thought it was strong of her to be able to leave her abusive husband, and purchase a house so quickly.",0
2546,relationships,"BACKSTORY LEADING TO: Right about 3 months ago, my petty cash came up missing ($200.00).",0
2547,relationships,I reported it immediately.,0
2548,relationships,"She keeps using the phrase ""right now"".",0
2549,relationships,"Whenever I ask her about us she says ""right now, no, but in the future who knows?""",0
2550,relationships,I decided to put no contact measures into place as I could not give her what she wants while staying in contact with her.,0
2551,relationships,"When this happened she was bawling over the phone, but she never questioned it.",0
2552,relationships,"I've been with my girlfriend since I was I was 16, and there are no real problems.",0
2553,relationships,"For the past few months, I don't find myself enjoying being around her anymore, enjoy talking to her, or wanting to do anything ""special"" in general like I used to.",0
2554,relationships,I'm not interested in anybody else by any means.,0
2555,relationships,"She has helped me with a lot, would do anything or me, and has never done anything to hurt me or cheated.",0
2556,relationships,"She's the best partner you could ask for, but even still when she talks I don't want to listen.",0
2557,relationships,"But we didn't talk about it the morning after, and life went on.",0
2558,relationships,"Over the next year, we would continue to stay up late at house parties or whatever the occasion was (until 3, 4, 5 AM) about once a month, and just talk and talk and talk, until we inevitably hooked up.",0
2559,relationships,Keep in mind he was still dating someone else.,0
2560,relationships,"Eventually during one of these moments, I worked up the courage to indirectly get a pulse on his feelings.",0
2561,relationships,"More or less, he said he thinks about me multiple times a day, which was different from anyone else he ""dated"" prior.",0
2562,relationships,"She never disclosed any of this to me, and probably never would have if the embassy hadn't discovered it first.",0
2563,relationships,"In her words, she was afraid I would lose all interest in her if I found out she was married before.",0
2564,relationships,"Truth be told, I likely would have, as I was still young when we first met.",0
2565,relationships,She claims she left that husband because of the abuse she received from him and his relatives ((still lived with his parents)).,0
2566,relationships,"I was crushed at that time, as we had only been married for about a month.",0
2567,relationships,Whats the chances of his employer asking for his certificate randomly?,0
2568,relationships,I feel like he cant apply to other jobs at more prestigious companies.,0
2569,relationships,"As someone who who tried very hard to get her degree and succeeded, his lack of care and access to these jobs undermines my work.",0
2570,relationships,"My mom [54F] has catered to his every need since marriage, and although she complains about it constantly, she still goes along with it.",0
2571,relationships,"There are some events concerning him that have occurred throughout my life that have caused me to come to resent him (and my mom too sort of): From as far back as I can remember, to this day (although it's much less now), my parents have had screaming matches.",0
2572,relationships,"My dad's face turning red and spit flying, as he yells and often curses at the top of his lungs to my mom, and her crying and screaming back.",0
2573,relationships,But I did give her the benefit of the doubt because that could have just been her character.,0
2574,relationships,However the things she were saying were very icky for my liking and I was uncomfortable about 10 minutes in.,0
2575,relationships,It’s very vague in my mind as it was a while ago but what I remember was that She said “ I hope you dont mind Harry cuddling me when I’m poorly and when we Netflix and chill” and “what are WE doing Friday?” (Me and Harry arranged a date night as we were both off work and college on this day. ),0
2576,relationships,I remember looking at harry and kind of giving him a confused WTF look.,0
2577,relationships,I started noticing her internet behavior more over the past few months and it's been kind of bothering me.,0
2578,relationships,"My girlfriend is a very intelligent and mature person, but when she gets online it's like she acts totally different.",0
2579,relationships,"For one, she sends me screencaps of her ""trolling"" people.",0
2580,relationships,"I mean, trolling?",0
2581,relationships,She's almost 30.,0
2582,relationships,The first is my girlfriend of around 9 months.,0
2583,relationships,She doesn't really like her current living situation and suggested we look together.,0
2584,relationships,"The positives here are that we get along pretty well as far as my relationships have gone, and it would save me money, probably around $5-600 a month.",0
2585,relationships,That's not insignificant.,0
2586,relationships,"The thing is I probably *could* be ready for that step if I had to, I'm just not really for or against it.",0
2587,relationships,"Alright, I'll try to keep this as short as possible.",0
2588,relationships,**Some Background:** I have a co-worker we'll call Pamela.,0
2589,relationships,"Pamela is disabled from complications and defects from when she was born; she has a brain shunt, and some cognitive issues.",0
2590,relationships,"However, it's not enough to impair her too greatly obviously because she has worked in the call center I work at for about 12 years or so, and in other call centers before this.",0
2591,relationships,"She receives accommodations for a disability at work though, such as having to meet less strict stats (like time per phone call, or time spent working offline) and being allowed to take a ""rest"" break if her disability causes her issues.",0
2592,relationships,"This has caused quite a few disagreements, as we often compromise for a ""quickie"" at some later time.",0
2593,relationships,"I love her dearly, and want to make this work, but I'm also worried that I shouldn't have gone this far into a relationship without a frame of reference for what I would want in one.",0
2594,relationships,"She is my first girlfriend, but I'm afraid to throw away a relationship that's caused me to love someone so dearly.",0
2595,relationships,"I've been cautious up to this point, but it does appear as though we have begun to get financially ""entangled"".",0
2596,relationships,"And it may be a bit out of context, but I do have to thank my 4 best men for being here with me all the way, I couldn’t do this without them.",0
2597,relationships,"Finally, we are here at the present day.",0
2598,relationships,It’s been 2 years since we broke up.,0
2599,relationships,"My ex still hates me with a burning passion, but I have learned to ignore it and have mostly moved on from the experience.",0
2600,relationships,"I don’t hold any sort of animosity towards her, but I have had the tendency to start to drift off and start pitying myself and reflecting out loud a bit too much when in conversation with my dear friend.",0
2601,relationships,Hi everyone.,0
2602,relationships,I met a great guy - let's call him Dave - about a year ago.,0
2603,relationships,We started off as friends but started dating around November.,0
2604,relationships,Let me preface this by saying that Dave is probably the best boyfriend I've ever had.,0
2605,relationships,"He'll drive an hour just to see me, always pays when we go out for food or drinks and is reluctant even when I insist to pay.",0
2606,relationships,"I do not originate from that country, but my family lives only a 3 hour ride away.",0
2607,relationships,After Christmas (which we did not spend together) I came to visit her and her family and eventually spend New Years Eve with them.,0
2608,relationships,"It was all fine apart from some little ""fights"" between my gf and me.",0
2609,relationships,There were always some small things that led to discussions.,0
2610,relationships,"For example: We went out with the dog and when we got back, my shoes were pretty dirty.",0
2611,relationships,"She didn’t have room for it where she was currently living, it had been so long since she was able to create.",0
2612,relationships,"We moved things out of storage, into the studio.",0
2613,relationships,I was so excited to not only be providing this place for her but to be the one she trusted with some of the most precious things to her.,0
2614,relationships,"I bought her a clay wheel and accessories, she wanted to work in the medium again.",0
2615,relationships,"I’ll never forget the first evening we threw clay together, it was very meaningful and romantic.",0
2616,relationships,"When we got to Food Lion, she got out of the car and said, “Your daddy bought you this car.” And slammed the car door and left.",0
2617,relationships,She apologized later.,0
2618,relationships,"New Years eve, my mom (65) gets a call from my cousin (50-60 don’t know her age), the primary caregiver for my grandma, that my uncle (same uncle from earlier) was admitted to the hospital the day before and was ready to be released.",0
2619,relationships,She couldn’t pick him up because she lives an hour away.,0
2620,relationships,My mom and I picked him up and took him home.,0
2621,relationships,I dated my ex-girlfriend for 6 years.,0
2622,relationships,She was madly in love with me for most of the relationship then had a falling out in the last year of the relationship where things turned ugly.,0
2623,relationships,I went through depression and hit a rough patch which also made me insecure which gave her the power in the relationship.,0
2624,relationships,"I also put us both through some unnecessary times and abused the love and time she gave me, she tried really hard, I was too stubborn.",0
2625,relationships,Eventually near the end I was a bit vulnerable and she left.,0
2626,relationships,"Sally is around the same age, 25 I assume, (can’t confirm numbers, sorry about that) and she quickly became a red flag for me.",0
2627,relationships,He would mention her name occasionally and how our love for the same type of shows was shared with Sally.,0
2628,relationships,Sally and I met a few times.,0
2629,relationships,The first time was when we planned a day out shopping with a mutual friend who was single at the time and my bf decided to invite Sally.,0
2630,relationships,"I thought that was a little weird, but justified it because 1) I had never met her and thought that would be a great opportunity to and 2) He said maybe the two of them would hit it off.",0
2631,relationships,--- TL;DR; Ghosted after over a month of talking to a guy.,0
2632,relationships,Met in hotel room.,0
2633,relationships,Made out but didn't have sex.,0
2634,relationships,If he didn't want to cheat or chickened out at the last minute why would he carry on so long with me?,0
2635,relationships,She would be coming to the states for the first time in over 10 years on Dec. 30.,0
2636,relationships,I was ecstatic to finally meet my MIL.,0
2637,relationships,We've chatted on several occasions and she is truly a great person.,0
2638,relationships,Rob was excited too so he wanted to make her trip memorable.,0
2639,relationships,He decided he wanted to get a family portrait painted for her as a late Christmas gift.,0
2640,relationships,Anna claimed he was a distant friend and had been kicked out of his house in the frigid weather.,0
2641,relationships,"My mom said nope, no way that boy stays there.",0
2642,relationships,Anna seemed to be telling lies again.,0
2643,relationships,"Fast forward a few days, and Anna's mother takes her phone away after a series of lies and deceit.",0
2644,relationships,"It turns out, the man was not a distant friend.",0
2645,relationships,"She already knows the password to my laptop, email, bank account, and phone PIN.",0
2646,relationships,"I didn't really want to tell her any of those, but I could not think of a reason why not to.",0
2647,relationships,"When I got a new phone, she set up my new PIN and got a bit upset when I changed it.",0
2648,relationships,"She said if I had nothing to hide, then she should know my passwords.",0
2649,relationships,"I don't have anything to hide, so I told her.",0
2650,relationships,He would tell me it was the best university in the world(a white lie) and how great it was.,0
2651,relationships,I didn't want to go there.,0
2652,relationships,I didn't aid in the application process at all.,0
2653,relationships,He did everything.,0
2654,relationships,"He wanted me to go there because it was cheap, and he assumed that if it were otherwise either i would just do nothing or spend a lot more money on school than he'd like.",0
2655,relationships,all the sudden all the hate turned against me again (happened often before).,0
2656,relationships,"She yelled out, whining for her dad, who she called.",0
2657,relationships,i stayed calm but was totally clueless about what to do.,0
2658,relationships,"she started breaking up with me, telling me that she will spent the night at a hotel or somewhere on the street.",0
2659,relationships,i shouldnt come visit her at the hospital next week ... blackmailing me basically.,0
2660,relationships,She did not acknowledge his invite to come down for Christmas.,0
2661,relationships,Then they go on the trip 2 days later and everything is peachy keen.,0
2662,relationships,-Her car broke down so my dad leant her my mom's car that we still have.,0
2663,relationships,"She said that he needed to quit referring to it as my mom's car....like, legally it's my mom's car.",0
2664,relationships,I agreed and the four of us had dinner and I dropped them back home to Kate[18F]'s house where they were staying the night because her parents were not home.,0
2665,relationships,"As I was pulling away Jamie[17F] ran up to my car and asked me if I wanted to stay the night with them, at first I was hesitant but I eventually agreed because I thought other guys were coming round.",0
2666,relationships,It turned out the other guys couldnt make it and it was just me and the three drunk girls.,0
2667,relationships,I asked Kate[18F](it was her house) if I could get some MDMA and drop it tonight and she agreed if I got her some.,0
2668,relationships,I drove us to the bottle shop where Jamie[17F] got her friend to buy us some more alcohol and went to get the MDMA which me and Kate did while Jamie and Sophie just drank.,0
2669,relationships,"Now, this was my first long term serious relationship and at the time, i wasn’t aware if what he was asking me to do was normal or not.",0
2670,relationships,"But i loved him with everything i had, so i gave up my oldest and greatest friendship for this guy i loved.",0
2671,relationships,Who ruined me.,0
2672,relationships,"Myself and Alex have always been a bit flirty, but never made a move on one another.",0
2673,relationships,"He would come to me about relationship advice, i never before had feelings for him and i would help him wholeheartedly with any issues he had.",0
2674,relationships,Maybe 2-3 crazy fights but nothing major.,0
2675,relationships,"Joe came back, frankly Joe spent ~ a year asking me to go out with him and my gut did not agree, it just felt off, now don’t get me wrong I have loved Joe since I was 17 but I just felt like this wouldn’t be right.",0
2676,relationships,"I asked Joe for a year, I studied far away, and it was my last year at uni, I asked Joe to give me that year.",0
2677,relationships,But Joe said Nah.,0
2678,relationships,"Joe gave the whole I have changed speech which every girl has probably heard a gazillion times in her life, but still thinks its novel.",0
2679,relationships,"He is (objectively) pretty unlikable- only talks about himself when speaking to you- but you know, I try to see the best in people and ignored it when I talk to him.",0
2680,relationships,He claims he is bisexual.,0
2681,relationships,"He introduced me to his lab partner, my current girlfriend, and I asked him if he was interested before pursuing her.",0
2682,relationships,He stated clearly no.,0
2683,relationships,"Fast forward three months, it is winter break, and they are hanging out a bit frequently.",0
2684,relationships,So let’s say I like person b [16F] and recently went on a date with her.,0
2685,relationships,"Person b [16F] tells me that my best friend is telling his girlfriend (who is person b’s best friend) everything that me, person c[16M] (our best friend as well), and other boyfriend discuss as a group of really tight friends.",0
2686,relationships,And I mean everything.,0
2687,relationships,"Person b doesn’t want me to say anything, but should I confront other boyfriend, tell friend c, or just shrug it off?",0
2688,relationships,**TL;DR** Us three guys have been friends for three years now and met these girls about 6 months ago; what should I do?,0
2689,relationships,"I have known her for several years and we are somewhat close but not ""best friends"".",0
2690,relationships,She confided in me that her brother died and I want to be there for her in any way that I can.,0
2691,relationships,I currently live 5+ hrs away from where she lives so I can't physically be there for her.,0
2692,relationships,Are there any sayings that I should avoid or use?,0
2693,relationships,What helped you after the loss of a loved one?,0
2694,relationships,"EDIT: I should also mention that when I do fall asleep, I snore REALLY loudly and I can hear myself in my sleep.",0
2695,relationships,My boyfriend says that it sounds like I'm not breathing or trying to breathe.,0
2696,relationships,Don't want it to drive a wedge between my boyfriend and I.,0
2697,relationships,No reply.,0
2698,relationships,I texted again a couple hours later and he again didn't reply.,0
2699,relationships,I saved myself the embarrassment and just didnt go out that night.,0
2700,relationships,I texted him the next day to ask what happened.,0
2701,relationships,Its been a week already since this happened and be hasn't once texted me.,0
2702,relationships,And after every episode with them he treats me like shit for a couple hours at work I assume wondering if I know about his behaviour and if I’ll say anything.,0
2703,relationships,"It’s my world, and my people, and I’m his superior.",0
2704,relationships,"He’s not going to win a power struggle, so I don’t even have to worry about it.",0
2705,relationships,Other days we get along fine from 9-5.,0
2706,relationships,"I am moving in with my BF and am fine with doing it 'early' because I love him and want to spend more time with him, I am moving back to my hometown where I have a large safety net, and we are choosing an apartment that he can afford on his own if he needs to.",0
2707,relationships,"I know having a back up plan doesn't sound romantic, but both he and I have discussed all of the above, and both of us are long term planners who place 'back-up' plans in place in case anything goes awry.",0
2708,relationships,I have always been in relationships where I was still able to be an independent unit and avoid too much commitment because I was always scared to lose my independence.,0
2709,relationships,"But this is the first relationship where I feel like we're a really good fit, and it doesn't feel like a sacrifice I don't want to make.",0
2710,relationships,"I will still be doing a lot of things on my own, he is also an independent person, and both of us have lived on our own for years and know we can take care of ourselves.",0
2711,relationships,I apologised and thought that was the end of it.,0
2712,relationships,"It’s gotten to the point that if I walk into a room, she’ll leave straight away, and if she doesn’t leave, or if I start talking to her or someone else, she sighs a lot so I know my presence is not wanted.",0
2713,relationships,"If I’m in her general direction of travel, she’ll be sure to make a wide berth around me, and the only time she’s spoken a full sentence to me was to say “thanks for my present” that I got her for Christmas.",0
2714,relationships,Then we get to tonight.,0
2715,relationships,Eva and one of my brothers are staying over at our cousins house.,0
2716,relationships,I'll have written a letter to give to her.,0
2717,relationships,The letter is to repeat what I wanted to say for later so that she can read in case she has any misunderstandings or if I don't communicate it well.,0
2718,relationships,Obviously I don't want to say the reason is because of her physical appearance.,0
2719,relationships,Should I say I only see her as a friend but nothing greater than that?,0
2720,relationships,I've been dating a single mom with two kids from two different guys who help out.,0
2721,relationships,She was married to the first for several years and has a 2 year old with the other.,0

2725,relationships,We live together.,0
2726,relationships,We definitely have issues were working through right now but our relationship has been pretty good.,0

2729,relationships,Normal start of our day.,0
2730,relationships,"He asked ""was the card worth the wait?""",0
2731,relationships,"I answered ""Yes, I cried, at the park"" he jokingly said ""of course you did, tiny tears x"" and then he asked ""did you take photos of the chocolates?""",0
2732,relationships,"I said ""yes babe"" and sent him the photo - he was still online but the last 2 messages wasnt read.",0
2733,relationships,"The next message i sent was all about my day - that wasnt sent anymore, he was offline... i thought he was getting ready for his work and his phone died or his network... after an hour, I got worried, so I sent messages on all social media that he has, which I know.",0
2734,relationships,"I had no problem with that, but was kind of surprised that this was the first time I was hearing his cousin's name that he missed so dearly he spent 600 dollars on a plane ticket to go visit.",0
2735,relationships,"I did not think much of it, but noticed that over the course of a couple weeks, he was constantly getting snapchats from Jessica, but was reluctant to open them in front of me.",0
2736,relationships,"That was another thing that surprised me because he always would open things in front of me, and never had a problem with me on his phone.",0
2737,relationships,"If he did open a snapchat from Jessica, he kind of pulled his phone closer to him so I couldn't see his screen.",0
2738,relationships,"I noticed his phone background one day, and saw that it was a happy birthday card with a picture drawn on it, signed from Jessica.",0
2739,relationships,When we had our first fight I did EVERYTHING I could to gain her back in my life.,0
2740,relationships,"I quit smoking cigarettes because she went on a ""I hate all drugs and anything smokable"" rant.",0
2741,relationships,I tried to be more mindful and kind because she said I was the opposite.,0
2742,relationships,I tried to change because I wanted my best friend back.,0
2743,relationships,4 months later she let me back in and I was so fucking happy.,0
2744,relationships,My girlfriend and I met through a messaging app.,0
2745,relationships,"We come from the same country and speak the same language, so there is a sense of familiarity and closeness right from the start.",0
2746,relationships,"However, as we grow closer, I'm starting to feel like she does not value our relationship as much as I do.",0
2747,relationships,I always put her above all else.,0
2748,relationships,I always try to find ways to accommodate her busy schedule.,0
2749,relationships,Some day it’s gonna piss them off and she’ll get killed.,0
2750,relationships,She lets people go ahead of her in line if she has more items than them.,0
2751,relationships,She lets people out of junctions even if she’s running late to places.,0
2752,relationships,Ends up holding doors open for tons of people and can get stuck there for almost a minute.,0
2753,relationships,Gave up her seat on a bus once when she knows I have a bad back and like to sit down.,0
2754,relationships,"I've never been on this side of the road, being the one to let someone know I'm not interested.",0
2755,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Person wants to hook me up with his adoptive sister, we have nothing in common, how do I tell her that I'm not interested?",0
2756,relationships,I want that.,0
2757,relationships,I want him as well as a SO but maybe I need more time.,0
2758,relationships,Maybe I'm more invested than even he is.,0
2759,relationships,"At some point in the past year, we discussed living together.",0
2760,relationships,She seemed to be okay with it and never had any objections.,0
2761,relationships,"Since both our rental agreements will soon expire (hers in May and mine in July), I started looking for a new place online.",0
2762,relationships,"However, I noticed that she never really responded enthusiastically about anything I showed her or just plain ignored it.",0
2763,relationships,"Last weekend, I confronted her and she admitted that she no longer wants to move in together, saying it is too soon for her and that she had been thinking about it for a long time.",0
2764,relationships,My girlfriend and I have been dating now for 3 months.,0
2765,relationships,We have a very happy relationship most of the time.,0
2766,relationships,I love her and she loves me and we spend almost all our time together.,0
2767,relationships,She can be insecure at times and has a couple mood swings where she can be very happy to very upset.,0
2768,relationships,I do my best to bring her out of those slumps and usually I do.,0
2769,relationships,Email her?,0
2770,relationships,"She lives in his hometown, so an in-person meeting is not possible, nor do I think it would be wise.",0
2771,relationships,Should I do it anonymously?,0
2772,relationships,"Should I provide screen shots of our conversations right off the bat, or wait and see if she requests it?",0
2773,relationships,I could write a long book about it.,0
2774,relationships,The issue: My current issue is a strange one and I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts about it.,0
2775,relationships,"Whenever my inlaws visit and stay the night, they bring 1 set of clean clothes and wash the ones they are wearing EVERY NIGHT.",0
2776,relationships,They do this regardless of the number of nights they are staying.,0
2777,relationships,I began to see a therapist and started taking some medication for my mood.,0
2778,relationships,I was really trying to improve myself.,0
2779,relationships,"The first medication I tried, I now believe, made things like social anxiety worse.",0
2780,relationships,I recently found a medication (Zoloft) that has changed my life.,0
2781,relationships,"I had been exercising, going out of my way to connect with old friends who I like in an effort to curb the isolation etc.",0

2787,relationships,"He says she is a great girl, caring for him and he thinks she loves him.",0
2788,relationships,"He, however, felt mostly intense passion and says he misses the spiritual connection.",0
2789,relationships,"I think its still too soon for him to know after a few days, as the group of friends returned home and he is some more time on the road.",0
2790,relationships,"He said even if he does not know what will happen, he must explore the passion with the new girl and he is happy that it happened.",0
2791,relationships,He said he feels a bit guilty cause its mostly passion he feels and the girl seems to be really into him.,0
2792,relationships,"The problem is that before I even ask for him to do this like a grown up, I have gone fully Zuko fire bender mode and decided to unleash my wrath on Joe for not doing this.",0
2793,relationships,Other stupid occasions I have done this?,0
2794,relationships,"Well, did it cause when we were long distance he wouldn’t initiate calling (I know Joe too well to know this is just unnatural for him), holding my hand more than he does, coming home and giving me a kiss, honestly he has a faster pace and I even equated him sometimes not walking at my pace as him not caring.",0
2795,relationships,"He puts up with my rage and abuse, he helps with my mother (who is nuts herself, so I guess I take after her), he has offered financial help if I need it (doing MSc).",0

2797,relationships,My mum storms off on a regular basis and says no one cares about her or whatever.,0

2802,relationships,Downloaded Tinder a couple years ago after my last long term relationship.,0
2803,relationships,"Never thought I'd find someone I might actually be interested in and haven't met someone from Tinder in a few months because I don't love the thought of it, wasn't meeting the kind of girls I really want to date and I'm not getting any younger.",0

2809,relationships,She’s super cute and we have hung out as friends on several occasions.,0
2810,relationships,"It is the winter and Tyler and I have been going out ice fishing a lot, it’s nice because I get to spend time with him and it’s something we both like to do.",0
2811,relationships,"Well, once Zack found out, he tells Tyler all the time how they should go, etc.",0
2812,relationships,"Well, Tyler fills up his truck (it is never under $120), fills up the four-wheeler ($60), and Zack walks over to our house with nothing but a helmet.",0
2813,relationships,"He has absolutely no ice fishing gear, but knows Tyler does and, again, uses Tyler under the guise of “friendship” so he can go.",0
2814,relationships,"AKA, I don’t get to go anymore.",0
2815,relationships,He agreed.,0
2816,relationships,"I told him a million times, when we were together and after we broke up, that loyalty is my #1 in relationship, period.",0

2818,relationships,Yet recently found out that I was cheated on for more than 6 months before we broke up.,0
2819,relationships,"Despite that, all the following is true: * We have both called each other BF/GF and referred to there being a relationship * We have had (oral, but not PIV yet) sex a few times, slept together naked, and have had many intimate conversations, including the last time we saw each other * We both mentioned early on that we aren't currently dating anyone else * We have both talked about going to specific events and doing things together in the future",0
2820,relationships,We were long-distance for a few months although we visited each other almost every weekend.,0
2821,relationships,In that time she was very jealous and controlled my movements because she thought I was doing something with very girl who looked at me.,0
2822,relationships,"In that time-frame, I took to hiding pictures that I had with friends who were girls, especially ones she was especially jealous of.",0
2823,relationships,"Nothing sexual, just selfies on a night out or whatever.",0
2824,relationships,"Back in November of 2015, my Junior year of college, I was a hermit socially but had many great and supportive friends (funnily enough were 90% women).",0
2825,relationships,"However, I was lonely as hell, had never dated, and it was driving me mad and depressing me.",0
2826,relationships,"I didn't let it show though, except to one or two friends who knew me very well.",0
2827,relationships,In the month of november I started hanging out with an organic chemistry study group.,0
2828,relationships,Two particular women were part of this group.,0
2829,relationships,I grew up fairly disadvantaged compared to my friends.,0

2831,relationships,"In addition, I've been consistently abused since I was 8 years old, the same age I met my best friend.",0
2832,relationships,She's much wealthier than I am.,0

2834,relationships,I matched with a girl who I thought was pretty on a dating app.,0
2835,relationships,"I said hi first, and she replied.",0
2836,relationships,"We went on to introduce ourselves and ask basic questions such as what we do, whats our favorite food, music, and things like that.",0
2837,relationships,Then we decided to meet up in real life.,0
2838,relationships,I forgot whether it was me or her who suggested that we meet up.,0
2839,relationships,"On his 21st birthday, he consumed way too much alcohol to celebrate, and I regrettably saw an entire different side of him.",0
2840,relationships,"I noticed that he had crazy eyes, and he was being very aggressive in speech.",0
2841,relationships,"He seemed very off to me, and demanded to know why I didn't want to sleep in his bed that night.",0
2842,relationships,"When I made up the excuse that I had to be up for something early in the morning, he demanded to know what was wrong with our relationship.",0
2843,relationships,"I kept calmly assuring him that we were fine, and that I just needed rest that night.",0
2844,relationships,To make up for it I made a cute little note and I made him a batch of his favorite cookies.,0
2845,relationships,"I was honestly so damn proud of the gift when I finished putting it together, it looked awesome!",0
2846,relationships,"To add some context, I have attended a few games with him (and the rest of the family) and absolutely loved them.",0
2847,relationships,"I didn’t care about the actual games themselves, but I loved being there with my family and the cool atmosphere and stuff.",0
2848,relationships,"Well, apparently my dad didn’t think it was so awesome.",0
2849,relationships,"She then decided to go to a party without me and said ""I would cancel my plans to see you, but you won't do the same for me.",0
2850,relationships,even though she was the one who left.,0
2851,relationships,I told her I didn't want to see her tonight after she tried to bait me into going over to her house.,0
2852,relationships,it’s the first relationship I’ve been in that feels “serious” and friends comment on how well we get along in public.,0
2853,relationships,We laugh a lot and we have the same sense of humor.,0
2854,relationships,I have been known as sort of a funny person and this is the first girl I’ve been with in a relationship that consistently makes me laugh hard.,0
2855,relationships,"Plus she is very caring and sweet, a good friend.",0
2856,relationships,"We have not had a serious fight in a long time, maybe more than 3 months.",0
2857,relationships,"Long story but a few years ago my wife of fifteen years, who had never been with anyone else opened up and told me she fantasized a lot about being with other men, and considered herself somewhat polyamorous.",0
2858,relationships,I was upset and it took a couple of years of us discussing this before I started to feel more comfortable with things.,0
2859,relationships,"We eventually started swinging (only about once every couple of months and always same room) as it seemed like a way for us to explore this part of her together, and it ended up being a lot of fun and something I really enjoyed that brought us closer together.",0
2860,relationships,"Well, it’s been a couple of years and I’ve felt happy and comfortable with where we are at but  I decided to ask my wife the other day and she said she was happy but she also had a desire to date people separately, and would be willing to try it if I was.",0
2861,relationships,"This isn't the first time this has happened, even with my ex I used to put effort into creating funny and deep conversations and she'd make quite surface level replies, but I thought it was because she was severely depressed so I didn't mind making an effort with her.",0
2862,relationships,She doesn't have many hobbies and works in a pub so I can't talk about her interests really as the only think she kinda likes is textiles and she doesn't do it anymore as she's so focused on her job.,0
2863,relationships,"I should probably mention she's really really shy, which she has admitted to me.",0
2864,relationships,"For example, when we meet in person, she's so nervous that she's physically shaking for about 15 minutes until she relaxes.",0
2865,relationships,4)/5) Couldn't count it.,0
2866,relationships,He loses sleep because he games until 2-3 AM regularly.,0
2867,relationships,"I think 4 hours might be a low-end estimate, but I don't want to say he games EVERY day.",0
2868,relationships,"He doesn't go out with ""real life"" friends, except if I invite him out with my friends.",0
2869,relationships,"Numerically - yes, we spend time together, but about 12 of those hours are spent sleeping.",0
2870,relationships,"Long story short - my housemate's sister and I are super interested in each other, and I wanted to surprise her with a gift for a (very!)",0
2871,relationships,belated Christmas for when I get back home.,0
2872,relationships,"We've known each other about a year, and we've been on one pretty damn romantic midnight tour of Dubai as a date.",0
2873,relationships,I know she is interested because she made the first move.,0
2874,relationships,"In any case, both of us are into books, and I wanted to give her a favourite of mine (Paul Beatty's The Sellout) with the inscription: 'To X, I can only hope this book makes you laugh half as much as you make me.",0
2875,relationships,Generally good marriage.,0

2880,relationships,As title says.,0
2881,relationships,"I have enough money to buy a house, my girlfriend has only just started working.",0
2882,relationships,It seems to make financial sense for me to go ahead and make the purchase- I'd be paying toward my mortgage instead of rent and my girlfriend can stay and pay cheaper rent.,0
2883,relationships,"However, when I spoke to her.",0
2884,relationships,"That being said, I love her when she is good, otherwise we wouldn’t be together.",0
2885,relationships,She tells she didn’t want to tell all those mean things.,0
2886,relationships,But then she does it again.,0

2888,relationships,This is where she met her current best friend.,0
2889,relationships,Let's call him Rob.,0
2890,relationships,"Now, she met this guy while she was still dating her ex.",0
2891,relationships,"They had issues after a couple of years (more than 2), apparently that was the time she and her best friend started to get really close.",0
2892,relationships,"In her own words, they started texting a lot, going out with their colleagues a lot, etc.",0
2893,relationships,She'd deleted evidence years ago.,0
2894,relationships,"Yet she sat me down, told me she'd been  groomed and it was my fault for not telling her.",0
2895,relationships,It was my fault she'd be single forever.,0
2896,relationships,We're talking incidents happening from when I was 6 through to 16.,0
2897,relationships,"He put a hand on my shoulder and smiled and said, ""You sure are.""",0
2898,relationships,It goes in a circle.,0
2899,relationships,He made me feel better there by affirming that he thinks I'm worthwhile.,0
2900,relationships,"Great, that'll probably get on his nerves.",0
2901,relationships,I’m not living a lavish lifestyle or rolling around in money.,0
2902,relationships,I explained to her that if we divided rent based on income percentage she would actually be paying more per month.,0
2903,relationships,All this on top of the fact that she turned down a free car.,0
2904,relationships,It feels really unfair because I think she blames me for moving us to a “more expensive” location for my new job.,0
2905,relationships,So in her mind she shouldn’t have to pay anything more than the dirt-cheap rent I was charging her to live with me at my house.,0
2906,relationships,feel free to delete or disregard if this isn't in the right sub.,0
2907,relationships,I saw a guy for months having sex a couple times a week.,0
2908,relationships,"But not just that, hanging out and being friends too.",0
2909,relationships,In December he asked me what we were.,0

2917,relationships,I am confident that training would fix 70% of the issues that she has with my dog.,0
2918,relationships,"To me a loving and healthy relationship is one that can come to compromises and that are no winners or losers, but agreements in place to help solve issues TOGETHER .",0
2919,relationships,"If she has trouble with compromising on a proper solution now, what will happen when it comes to or much larger life decisions like buying a house or moving to a new city.",0
2920,relationships,"I was about to explain to her that we would be back later that night and if she was good, we'd bring her a treat.",0

2923,relationships,We live together and talk about spending the rest of our lives together.,0

2927,relationships,She taught me a bunch at first.,0
2928,relationships,In the beginning of the week people asked what me and my Ex did.,0
2929,relationships,I informed them we broke up and it was due to infidelity on her part.,0
2930,relationships,"This was not a cool move, however, I knew her sister would try to paint me as the bad guy.",0
2931,relationships,I was spot on.,0
2932,relationships,"Since we are both the only child, we both feel an equal responsibility to carry on our family lines, regardless of our own gender.",0
2933,relationships,What do you guys think would be an equitable solution to this problem?,0
2934,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Girlfriend wants future children to have her last name, but I am not comfortable with that due to social conditioning and/or the backlash I would face from my own parents.",0
2935,relationships,"The new man almost immediately moved to the flat previously shared with her ex, which I found strange, but I know she cannot be alone, perhaps because of her troubled childhood/daddy issues.",0
2936,relationships,"She later confessed she was completely out of her mind in this period, and she would not do it if having a clear head.",0
2937,relationships,"They never really ended contact, despite all the hurt.",0
2938,relationships,"She even met with her ex after 3 months apart, confessing she misses him and cried.",0

2941,relationships,"Knew everyone's bank account numbers, credit card due dates, utility bills, etc.",0
2942,relationships,Recently handed the task of money management to my dad because she was forgetting to pay bills.,0
2943,relationships,"- On her way to the grocery store, forgot where she was driving to; ended up at my dad's work instead",0
2944,relationships,Then about 25 minutes later I got a message from her saying that she was downstairs with Annie and her friends pre-drinking so I came down.,0
2945,relationships,I asked her how long she was down for and she said the whole time as Annie was already downstairs.,0
2946,relationships,"I asked her why she didn't let me know everyone was downstairs already, instead of just leaving me in my room by myself to which she replied ""don't worry about it, it's no big deal.""",0
2947,relationships,"I said it seemed weird she just din't think to tell me for nearly half an hour to which she rolled her eyes and said ""oh don't you start.""",0
2948,relationships,I decided it wasn't worth getting annoyed about it and didn't bring it up again.,0
2949,relationships,"Any problem he had, he would blame on me.",0
2950,relationships,"I eventually got out of the relationship, and when I ended it, he began obsessively texting me up to 30 times a day, talking to my family and lying to them about what was happening, etc.",0

2952,relationships,The last time we talked was in May 2017.,0
2953,relationships,I started my seizure while on the stairs and as a result was pretty badly injured.,0
2954,relationships,I broke my ankle and injured my knee.,0
2955,relationships,I also required stitches in my face.,0
2956,relationships,Let me make this very clear- I recognize that this experience must have been **terrifying** for Tom.,0
2957,relationships,"Also, stemming from the same background, I am still a virgin (he obviously is not) and I’m not quire sure how I feel about engaging in sexual intercourse with him.",0
2958,relationships,"Whenever we “talk” about sex, I feel like I’m lying about how I feel.",0
2959,relationships,It’s more of an interest in learning the different aspects of sex than actual sexual arousal (I’ve been questioning the possibility of asexuality).,0
2960,relationships,"If anything, I feel kind of giddy that someone thinks of me in that way but not in the “I want to have sex with you” way.",0
2961,relationships,"I’m trying to engage him with pictures/videos/etc., but it feels all fake to me.",0
2962,relationships,The problem is one of these guy friends.,0
2963,relationships,I'm typically pretty shy in new social settings and don't really like to make be at the focus of anyone's attention unless I'm comfortable with them.,0
2964,relationships,"When I first met these guys, it was like 2 polar opposites met.",0
2965,relationships,"I'm fairly quiet, reserved, respectful and I like to think I'm a smart person.",0
2966,relationships,"These friends, this one friend in particular, are loud, boorish and really rude.",0
2967,relationships,I can hardly step into his room because that is where it is most concentrated.,0
2968,relationships,I love keeping a clean and nice smelling apartment.,0
2969,relationships,I don't mind doing extra cleaning and buying extra air fresheners to keep it that way.,0
2970,relationships,"However, Matt's BO literally follows him around and lingers where ever he goes.",0
2971,relationships,"Anyway, couple months down the line, I met her family, loved them, they loved me (they're first impression of me was, get this, me clogging they're toileting and it overflowing with me yelling SOS through the bathroom door.. it was awesome lol).",0
2972,relationships,L and I continued to grow even closer as my now senior year progressed (her junior).,0
2973,relationships,Then March happened.,0
2974,relationships,L started to act wierd.,0
2975,relationships,"She talked sarcastically about how my life is ""obviously so horrible"" and I'd say ""yeah, mom, it is.""",0
2976,relationships,"She denied yelling at us all the time, and said that if I can say she yells all the time then she can say I yell all the time too (at my little siblings), which is just not true.",0
2977,relationships,"I am nice to my siblings, excluding today where I was angry at everything.",0
2978,relationships,"She said that for months I've been terrorizing her about this ""yelling thing"" and how I think that one small mistake automatically means someone is a bad person.",0
2979,relationships,Sorry if this is kinda long... We met in highschool and became best friends.,0
2980,relationships,"Even after we still talked everyday, hang out almost every weekend and I felt everything was okay.",0
2981,relationships,She then started getting kinda distant e cold toward me and I had no idea why.,0
2982,relationships,I talked to friend in commom and she said my this friend(I'll call her P.) felt that I was too negative and was always complaining.,0
2983,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Met this guy a few months ago, we've only hung out a few times.",0
2984,relationships,"I'm a little wary of the age gap and don't have much experience with accurately ""reading signals"".",0
2985,relationships,"He is mildly physically affectionate (leans towards me, hits my arm playfully, pulls things from my hair) and gives compliments that seem genuine and sincere, but aren't quite non platonic.",0
2986,relationships,What do you think/what should I look for?,0
2987,relationships,"Hello all, I'm a new submitter to this channel.",0
2988,relationships,I went here a few nights ago and honestly it's been helping me cope with my current situation by reading what others are going through.,0
2989,relationships,"One of the things I noticed is that a lot of responses are brutally honest -- and I am here for just that while still accepting that I'm a hopeless romantic who sees the value in ""If you really want it don't give up"".",0
2990,relationships,Let's get started -,0
2991,relationships,My online friend  -- let's call him Jim  -- is a Jehovah's Witness.,0
2992,relationships,I've known him on and off for about a decade.,0
2993,relationships,"Nowadays, we only email each other about thrice a year, but I still consider him one of my favorite online friends because of how deep and insightful our conversations are.",0
2994,relationships,We've rubbed each other the wrong way in the past because we have different ideas of God.,0
2995,relationships,I was raised as a Born Again Christian and am now looking into becoming a Unitarian Universalist.,0
2996,relationships,"I’ve been reading through the raised by narcissists subreddit that some of you linked to, and a lot of it matches with my experience growing up.",0
2997,relationships,The situation may be more severe then I had originally thought.,0
2998,relationships,"I am seeing a therapist for my anxiety, and the next time I have a session I’m going to bring get up everything I talked about here and maybe get some help in dealing with it.",0
2999,relationships,"Again, thanks to everyone who took time out of their day to give me advice when I was struggling, I really appreciate it.",0
3000,relationships,Sister kicked off because she wanted to come to.,0
3001,relationships,"It was a couple type thing and all of us were bringing a SO or a friend (if one of us didn’t have a partner) even if it wasn’t, I would have just wanted it to be Harry.",0
3002,relationships,As I don’t want his sister clinging on to us every single time.,0
3003,relationships,Harry asked me if she could come too because “it so unfair that you are isolating her like this.” I stood my ground and said that please can he just come.,0
3004,relationships,He said no.,0
3005,relationships,"come up and live with us and she'd leave me alone with him, wasted out of his mind, while she would be with her boyfriend (who shes now married to).",0
3006,relationships,Eventually I moved back with my dad and everything was fine.,0
3007,relationships,I'd call and talk to her and she sounded like she had her life together.,0
3008,relationships,"Well then they broke up for a short period of time, and she moved to live with her half siblings.",0
3009,relationships,"She would drink excessively, and call me and cry about her life.",0
3010,relationships,"I started talking to a girl, 'J', on Tinder about a month ago.",0
3011,relationships,"She's funny, attractive and quick-witted, however she was apprehensive to meet up for a drink to get to know each other in person straight away.",0
3012,relationships,We are both from the same town (we matched over Christmas) however she lives an hour and a half away in a much larger city.,0
3013,relationships,"She first claimed that she could not afford to travel to see me even when she was back in my town (she also refused to let me pay for anything involving her, including travel to her city to meet her), however said last week that she did not want to meet me until she knew that I was genuine about her, and wanted to talk on the phone every evening for a week.",0
3014,relationships,"If I did this, then she would meet me on the day afterwards.",0
3015,relationships,"His mother would say, ""Who would love you if you look like that?""",0
3016,relationships,"or ""Why couldn't I have a fit and handsome son.""",0
3017,relationships,So he has his own issues with his body image and weight.,0
3018,relationships,He also went a few years without being physical with anyone because he never thought that anyone would be interested or love him because of his appearance.,0
3019,relationships,He had a few years where he got very fit and had six pack but eventually lost it as he got older.,0
3020,relationships,"She never messaged him back, but I asked her why she still had him on Snapchat.",0
3021,relationships,I only asked it because she had claimed to have deleted her ex's on social media.,0
3022,relationships,"Whatever, that's a nice feeling and I'm glad, but at the same time it wouldn't really be an issue for me if she did still have them.",0
3023,relationships,Fast forward to last night... My fiance was acting all weird and put out so I tried figure out what was going on and what she was upset about.,0
3024,relationships,I have been trying to make plans recently and she keeps having things come up but i understand because i am doing it on kind of short notice.,0
3025,relationships,This last little bit after the break happened in about a 8 day span.,0
3026,relationships,TLDR: I am awkward and need some help with relationships.,0
3027,relationships,BACKGROUND: paul and i met 1.5 years ago on okcupid and hit it off right away.,0
3028,relationships,"at the time, we were both in long-term open relationships with other people, so we fell into a pretty quick routine that involved seeing each other once a week for a meal or drinks and sex [the best of his life, allegedly].",0
3029,relationships,"About 6 months into it/the December before last, he and his partner of 8 years broke up, which sent him into a bit of a depression/naturally intense period of introspection.",0
3030,relationships,"Independently/for unrelated reasons, my own longterm relationship also came to an end.",0
3031,relationships,Paul and I saw each other less but kept in touch.,0
3032,relationships,to me I feel like that is someone older than my current age dating an age that seems like a child to me....,0
3033,relationships,"I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a "" normal"" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any "" life skills"" and his answer was ""  not really"".",0
3034,relationships,What are people's thoughts on this?,0
3035,relationships,--- tl/dr...i'm creeped out by a man dating a woman 20 years younger even my last relationship was with a man 22 years older.,0
3036,relationships,"* Her, a week ago: Precious, how are you?",0
3037,relationships,(I ignored her.),0

3039,relationships,**You are one of the best people I have met in my life.,0
