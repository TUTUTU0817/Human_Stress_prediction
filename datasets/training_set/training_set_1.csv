153,ptsd,I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night.,1
154,ptsd,Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.,1

166,ptsd,At night I hear the sound and burst into tears and calm down until I hear it again and start crying.,1
167,ptsd,I didn’t know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but I’m beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it.,1

169,ptsd,I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?,1

172,ptsd,They discharged me.,1
173,ptsd,I never thought I’d be in a situation like that in my life and the screaming and blood and chaos following it is just on a constant repeat in my head that won’t stop.,1
174,ptsd,I had to give 4 separate statements to the police which burned it from start to finish in my brain and it doesn’t stop.,1
175,ptsd,I don’t know if that’s just because it was less than 24 hours ago and I’m still just in shock?,1

184,ptsd,"In some ways, I can handle it more than the average person who hasn't gone though such a trauma.",1

186,ptsd,I'm tired of people misunderstanding.,1
187,ptsd,I'm tired of feeling weak and broken.,1
188,ptsd,I'm just tired.,1

191,ptsd,"I had a panic attack where I felt terrified and unable to move at my psych's this past Tuesday, but that's not typical for me, at least not anymore?",1
192,ptsd,"I realized most my recent ""panic attacks"" may be ""breakdowns"" because it's not accompanied by a sense of fear, but pent up emotions I haven't been able to release resulting in a sudden loss of control...",1
193,ptsd,"I start hyperventilating, screaming, and unleash all this pent up fury to the point where I feel detached from my emotions/self and have no control, start throwing things or hurting myself, until I'm exhausted and suddenly shut down/dissociate.",1
194,ptsd,"For me, that doesn't HELP AT ALL.",1
195,ptsd,"It just makes me feel like I'm just pissing him off, and my problem has suddenly become his, minimizing my emotions about it?",1
196,ptsd,"He always says I need to be protected, but he doesn't understand that it's not an imminent threat in my life anymore, but a constant struggle and disability; that my brain works and processes things differently now and always will.",1
197,ptsd,I just feel so very alone when I talk to him.,1
198,ptsd,"but if so many people are here for me, and things are going to be okay, why am i still afraid of them?",1
199,ptsd,why do i still have a pit in my stomach and why are these thoughts still clawing at the sides of my skull?,1
200,ptsd,why am i crying right now?,1
201,ptsd,"i don't understand it, i don't understand my own brain and i feel like an ungrateful prick for still being shaken up so badly.",1
202,ptsd,"My problem is, if I'm going to date anyone, they have to be aware that I struggle with PTSD and willing to at least be there for me when I need.",1
203,ptsd,"I don't need coddling or protecting, I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out, or help me through a flashback.",1
204,ptsd,"Everytime I have had a breakdown, and try to express things from the past, he audibly growls and talks about how pissed he is that it happened.",1
205,ptsd,"But her response instead was the title ""I am not getting into this with you"".",1
206,ptsd,I wound up in partial hospitalization and diagnosed with PTSD related to several traumas including sexual assault I experienced as a child.,1
207,ptsd,"This will be a good thing in the end, but right now I feel like I'm going to throw up.",1
208,ptsd,I recently went through an event that was extremely traumatic.,1
209,ptsd,It's been less than a week and not even sure what I'm dealing with here but all I know is that I feel like I am being discouraged from getting help.,1
210,ptsd,"It’s becoming cyclical for me, where I “retreat” and revise and then feel like I need to retrigger myself to avoid slipping back into denial that it happened the way it happened.",1
211,ptsd,I can’t live like this.,1
212,ptsd,I don’t want to live a lie but sometimes the lie is what keeps me functioning.,1
213,ptsd,My therapist is away for a month and this means I have no one to push me to deal with this thing.,1
214,ptsd,I don’t know what to do.,1
215,ptsd,It’s really kind of ruining my ability to empathize with some people Bc of comments they’ve made in the past.,1
216,ptsd,I witnessed the attempted suicide of my sister and then subsequent self harm targeting just towards myself for the purpose of manipulation and dealt with no one believing that it happened.,1
217,ptsd,"So many people have told me be happy it was a failed attempt, failing to recognize the damage knowing someone I love could want to hurt me so badly did.",1
218,ptsd,Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that.,1
219,ptsd,And then I just want it to go away.,1
220,ptsd,"I dont know what to do about this, I feel like the world doesn't want me to talk about it.",1
221,ptsd,It's to uncomfortable for people...,1
222,ptsd,But I hate these feelings and they are just the tip of the iceburg that is ptsd.,1
223,ptsd,I felt like I needed to say something somwhere though.,1
224,ptsd,He got flustered really easily or would get angry over something simple—traffic or a common life situation.,1
225,ptsd,"He seems to have no patience anymore, especially with me and will just shut down.",1

227,ptsd,But the trauma remains.,1
228,ptsd,I've been out of therapy for almost 10 years but my coping mechanisms have been failing.,1
229,ptsd,I'm having breakdown after breakdown after the slightest trigger and there are SO MANY triggers!,1
230,ptsd,"I saw a professional for a psych evaluation and though there are no flashbacks or nightmares, I still am placed with the ptsd label.",1
231,ptsd,"I know this isn’t something you just “get over” I just thought I moved on from my “trauma” I watched a few episodes of bojack horseman and it’s thrown me into an episode of depression Idk I’m sad, I’m mad, I get irritable I have no idea what symptoms and triggers are for me, I just keep going because if I don’t I’ll stop and fall apart.",1
232,ptsd,I would’ve rather been told I’m a sociopath/psychopath or a narcissist due to my severe apathy towards everything.,1
233,ptsd,Update: I should probably add that I was terrified of my mom and never tried to provoke her.,1
234,ptsd,"My siblings would cry whenever they didn’t get what they wanted, they were rather spoiled, and would tell on me if I didn’t do what they wanted.",1
235,ptsd,Mom would be in the middle of homework or class and she’d just wail on me for no reason.,1

237,ptsd,"I cannot move, even though I am fully aware I am standing in the door.",1
238,ptsd,Do I force myself to move forward?,1
239,ptsd,Am I being ridiculous because I still have ptsd?,1
240,ptsd,I feel like they’re so out of line.,1
241,ptsd,I’m all over the place.,1
242,ptsd,As a result I had a total burn out.,1
243,ptsd,Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again.,1
244,ptsd,My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people.,1
245,ptsd,It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all.,1
246,ptsd,"Alcohol helps, but then it comes back worse the next day.",1
247,ptsd,"In the months that it's not happening, I'm well-adjusted.",1
248,ptsd,It's not really safe for me to be driving.,1
249,ptsd,I can't even function enough to do the grocery shopping.,1
250,ptsd,"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often.",1
251,ptsd,My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).,1
252,ptsd,I am afraid of anything and everything at the same time I am afraid of what happened or what may happen.,1
253,ptsd,"I am afraid the world, the earth, the skies, the stars, aliens, humans, animals, whatever fucking bullshit thought that had occurred in my head that makes my skin crawl.",1
254,ptsd,I am afraid of what I am or what I might become.,1
255,ptsd,"I am afraid that I might go crazy or fight that I might become boring, or normal, or average, or weird, or some fucking hippie, or some fucking stupid hard-headed person.",1
256,ptsd,"So, I survived years of physical and sexual abuse as a kid.",1
257,ptsd,I'm finally at the place in my counselling where my therapist and I both think I'm ready to work through it.,1
258,ptsd,"Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger, and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore, and my body felt all weird and flat, my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule, my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it.",1
259,ptsd,Things got better in middle school (thankfully) but it’s sad how literally 5 years as a young child (when life was supposed to be good) were so rough and still affect my life to this day.,1
260,ptsd,My home life wasn’t super bad but school was a living hell.,1
261,ptsd,I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting.,1
262,ptsd,"Sorry for the rant, it’s just sad how cruel teachers and students can be in elementary school.",1
263,ptsd,Bullying in elementary school directly caused so many of my mental health issues.,1
264,ptsd,"And I’ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can’t breathe I’m shaking I’m numb.",1
265,ptsd,"And he is there just reminding me, gently... this isn’t happening right now.",1
266,ptsd,I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive.,1
267,ptsd,My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day.,1
268,ptsd,My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents.,1
269,ptsd,I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it.,1
270,ptsd,"It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either.",1
271,ptsd,"Things are going downhill (not with my eating, which is good!",1
272,ptsd,"), but my PTSD symptoms are loud.",1
273,ptsd,"I'm not sleeping, my self harm has escalated and I'm struggling to leave my house.",1
274,ptsd,I'm also just about to lose my job because the company I work for is going under.,1
275,ptsd,"yesterday, I almost had sex with someone.",1
276,ptsd,"but when it was happening, I felt only halfway there.",1
277,ptsd,"and now my memory of it is hazy, and when I try to think about it I don't see it from my perspective, I see it from like above me.",1
278,ptsd,like it wasn't *actually*happening to me.,1
279,ptsd,Now my treatment has stopped this triggering from happening and sometimes think about moving back.,1
280,ptsd,The past few nights I have been drifting off to sleep and then I get the sensation that I'm falling and jerk awake.,1
281,ptsd,"I've had it happen before to me, but never like 50 times in a row that prevents me from sleeping.",1
282,ptsd,"But I do not even think the therapist is supposed to actually care, she actually seems to, but I cannot understand it.",1
283,ptsd,"I did not start therapy because I thought she would care, I started therapy because I jumped off a bridge 1 year ago and I have an 18 and 21 year old brother and sister who are too young to process a suicide, it would be wrong, so therapy is the thing I figured.",1
284,ptsd,"But another part of me feels tied down these days, I am getting tired of this town and want to pick up my pack and go on down that open road just as I have 16 times in these past 15 years and she is the only reason I don't.",1
285,ptsd,"It feels great, but I'm worried.",1
286,ptsd,I tried to kill myself one year and one month ago.,1
287,ptsd,I am prone to depression.,1
288,ptsd,"I am worried about crashing too hard, and I have kids to care for.",1
289,ptsd,I started to get depressed but was personally unaware.,1
290,ptsd,"My wife started to notice that I wasn't eating, was moody, not sleeping, and laying in bed all day.",1
291,ptsd,She asked me if I was ok and I... broke down.,1
292,ptsd,All emotions came to a tipping point and I started whaling in tears.,1
293,ptsd,I told her I had been thinking about suicide.,1
294,ptsd,I can't decide if it's healthy or not since most of the traumatic things that happened at home were in that space.,1
295,ptsd,"I'll find myself camped out, sobbing on the floor, but can't really pinpoint why it's the place I always seek out.",1
296,ptsd,It sucks.,1
297,ptsd,I know I need help.,1
298,ptsd,I want to get help.,1
299,ptsd,"I was sexually abused throughout my childhood (at least 10 years, possibly longer).",1
300,ptsd,I forgot the memories for a long time but now I'm finally getting them back and it's freaking me out.,1
301,ptsd,My sleep patterns are erratic because I don't want to sleep anymore.,1
302,ptsd,Is it normal to have PTSD with nightmares EVERY time I sleep?,1
303,ptsd,My psychologist has started trying to slowly desensitize me by showing me pictures and videos of what disturbs me: this is currently making things worse.,1
304,ptsd,And my nightmares are a terrifying mix of intense body horror and trauma flashbacks.,1
305,ptsd,So I wake up even more tired and in pain which makes me miserable during the day.,1
306,ptsd,"So now I'm having my chronic pain flaring up, my other PTSD symptoms kicking my ass, my other mental illnesses acting up, and on top of that I'm too tired from the nightmares to do anything about it.",1
307,ptsd,I just can't fucking win.,1
308,ptsd,I'm so so tired.,1
309,ptsd,"Hi everybody, I'm a 22 year old male who has had extreme depression and anxiety issues since I was 12 years old.",1
310,ptsd,And I’m scared all the time.,1
311,ptsd,"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories.",1
312,ptsd,And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating.,1
313,ptsd,I’m sorry.,1
314,ptsd,I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,1
315,ptsd,"my abuser is in my family, and i am in the process of healing but every family reunion/holiday i must see my abuser causing me to enter panic attacks, constant crying, and flashbacks, causing an uproar to what could make me so ""troubled"" I am afraid of coming out to my family in case of being removed for my family forever and damaging relationships.",1
316,ptsd,I have younger family members i am trying to protect so i feel alot of weight on my shoulders when i am having a bad PTSD episode around my abuser and my younger family members.,1
317,ptsd,Also there was an attempted rape on me when I was 21.,1
318,ptsd,I never realised how much an effect these events had on me.,1
319,ptsd,The problem is that I am married even though my marriage is awful.,1
320,ptsd,I grew up believing that everything bad that happened was my fault.,1
321,ptsd,"I have tried so hard to make something of my life after that hell, but now that everything feels like falling apart again I feel like I am breaking.",1
322,ptsd,This must mean that I am truly worthless and a waste of life.,1
323,ptsd,"I feel like I'm not even allowed to feel like this, because I deserve this hard life.",1
324,ptsd,Has anyone experienced horrible burn out because of PTSD/OCD?,1
325,ptsd,"I don’t have anything to ask atm or anything that anyone else need to know, but i cant go to someone when I’m not coping or in a state, I feel like it’s something I have to ride out on my own, that I can’t tell anyone about.",1
326,ptsd,"I hate going throw this on my own, not that my family don’t try to support me, I just don’t want to see mum cry again because I’m broken and she’s tryed every thing she can but nothing helps.",1
327,ptsd,"Iv had more 5 therapist and seen at least that again in one off meeting, but I can’t engage and have developed a vague phobia towards them, I used to hide in the house when I knew I had an appointment and only come out if I was promised I didn’t have to go.",1
328,ptsd,I can’t see my condition changing.,1
329,ptsd,I suffer from PTSD because I have been abused my entire life.,1
330,ptsd,I was physically abused by my teacher when I was 8 years old.,1
331,ptsd,"My mother physically, mentally and emotionally abused me, up until I left her house at 16.",1
332,ptsd,I had a skin graft.,1
333,ptsd,"It hurts, every day.",1
334,ptsd,"Not all the time, but usually when I'm upset or having a hard time.",1
335,ptsd,It'd be nice to know the pain isn't all in my head and maybe it's actually a physical consequence.,1
336,ptsd,It just hurts.,1
337,ptsd,"I thought if I changed, if I did everything for him, he would love me like I wanted him to.",1
338,ptsd,I broke it off a few days ago.,1
339,ptsd,I can't help but feel so guilty for doing so.,1
340,ptsd,"At least when I was 12, that man went to prison for 40 years.",1
341,ptsd,Where you relive your trauma and talk about it to take the emotional response and power away.,1
342,ptsd,I am just nervous and very scared.,1
343,ptsd,"But there is no certainty, and I am so scared I am going to fuck this up.",1
344,ptsd,But none of that seems meaningful in the dead of night when I cannot sleep and get so sad and ruminating.,1
345,ptsd,I just do not know what to do to improve it or fix it.,1
346,ptsd,"I grab my partner and told him “ we need to get out of here right fucking now!” We made hour way out of the building, as we were exiting the conditions increasingly got worse, just as we made the door the room flashover, my partner was already in the hallway I was still in the room.",1
347,ptsd,"Many times when firefighters are caught in a flash over the outcome is death, for me it was burns to years, wrists, and face.",1
348,ptsd,After that I started struggling with anxiety at work and home.,1
349,ptsd,On my days off I started to drink excessively.,1
350,ptsd,I'm currently almost 19 but suffered a lot of traumatic events within my immediate family between the ages of 10-15.,1
351,ptsd,"Earlier this year, I noticed that I had terrible body odor (I shower and wear deodorant everyday) whenever I left the house.",1
352,ptsd,"This was obviously accompanied by some unbearable anxiety, as well as very severe panic attacks.",1
353,ptsd,"I didn't tell anyone, not even my family.",1
354,ptsd,"They didn't know, they didnt know because they couldn't know.",1
355,ptsd,I can't stop feeling miserable.,1
356,ptsd,"It's not even because my ex is going crazy, because he's once again proven I don't get to control my own life.",1
357,ptsd,I can't let go of the prosecutor telling me I only hear what I want.,1
358,ptsd,"I don't even know what he was referring to, but it has to be true because I honestly don't remember agreeing to dismiss he case.",1
359,ptsd,"I'm guess I'm not doing as well as I thought, and I must be as crazy as I now feel.",1
360,ptsd,"I gathered my composure, went back and sulked until I was asked if I could put something in my eye sight to block it out.",1
361,ptsd,"I mentioned I was blocking the signs, she asked why and I said, well, I feel they are kind of negative... And then she told me ""They aren't negative, they are funny, and since you don't think so you should think on if you even want to work here"", walks away and proceeds to tell my boss it isn't working out with me........ all because I expressed that I felt the signs were negative.",1
362,ptsd,Stupid me for thinking dozens and dozens of instant in your face surprise red circles could ever equate to negativity.,1
363,ptsd,Self-esteem hit new lows and had already felt really humiliated about assault before and wanted to tell friends to stop feeling so bad about it and to be able to talk to someone on days when my PTSD got really bad.,1
364,ptsd,"But now I feel even more humiliated about it and feel like anyone that knows is going to see me as damaged, so theres a lot of shame.",1
365,ptsd,I'm also terrified to talk to anyone else about it.,1
366,ptsd,I was recently diagnosed with PTSD (theoretically CPTSD but that's not an official diagnosis so whatever).,1
367,ptsd,It's been 3 years since I escaped my abuser who abused me for 3 years as well.,1
368,ptsd,"However because I was so young (high school/college), people have disregarded the validity of my abuse- which results in me hiding it from the world.",1
369,ptsd,"That sucks, but it's not as bad as what it does to me.",1
370,ptsd,"On top of crippling anxiety about everyday life, I have a terrible fear of commitment that I didn't realize I had until I moved in with my current boyfriend.",1
371,ptsd,"And when I came out of this ""blackout"" I was really groggy and anxious.",1
372,ptsd,I’m struggling to figure out what’s wrong with me at the moment.,1
373,ptsd,"I’m slightly annoyed because before all of this she’s been taking me very seriously and helping with so much, and now I feel like she’s being demeaning?",1
374,ptsd,But I wish I could find a place where it isn't so dark.,1
375,ptsd,Usually after each session I get a headache also.,1
376,ptsd,"I can't tell if i'm becoming worse, because I did EMDR on my bad drug experiences and feel great now.",1
377,ptsd,"The rest of what i'm dealing with is early childhood trauma, which was prolonged so i'm thinking EMDR is just bringing out these feelings and making my body become very unhappy since im reprogramming it to not constantly be hyper aware and anxious.",1
378,ptsd,Ive had a few hospital visits because after some sessions i turn into a hypochondriac because the physical responses are so odd.,1
379,ptsd,One session made the left side of my face numb.,1
380,ptsd,I need quiet and darkness to recover from a major trigger like that.,1
381,ptsd,I went inside and sat in the bathroom with the lights off.,1
382,ptsd,"We had left the radio on in the bedroom and it was blaring so loudly, but I couldn't move I just needed to sit for a little bit.",1
383,ptsd,I thought I had calmed myself back down so I went into our office.,1
384,ptsd,He came into the office all furious.,1
385,ptsd,I can't go anywhere without and inhaler and I tested positive for asthma even though I've never had an issue before all this happened.,1
386,ptsd,I don't know what to do.,1
387,ptsd,I feel like I should go to get psychiatric help but now that I'm in college and only working part time I'm scared of not being able to pay the doctor bills.,1
388,ptsd,I don't know what to do.,1
389,ptsd,I’m really tired.,1
390,ptsd,I get triggered and I have to start all over again.,1
391,ptsd,It’s so hard to see the point in fighting all of this all the time.,1
392,ptsd,I still live with my abuser and sometimes I can make it.,1
393,ptsd,"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often.",1
394,ptsd,My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).,1
395,ptsd,I'm not getting any resources from the VA and I'm not getting better.,1
396,ptsd,"I've been kicked out of the MHICM Range program because ""I'm not making enough progress”—ie not magically getting better.",1
397,ptsd,"After about six months there, my therapist told me I was ""too depressed to help.""",1
398,ptsd,I can't remember what was in the marital home when I left.,1
399,ptsd,I left under duress.,1
400,ptsd,"I am still piecing together weird, incongruous chunks of time, flashbacks, disjointed memories, and trying to figure out what happened; it seems like my brain just can't access specific details when I'd like it to.",1
401,ptsd,"The problem here, other than everything, is that I don't feel like my attorney gets why I'm such a useless participant right now, and I could use some advice on explaining it.",1
402,ptsd,Do I have my therapist call my attorney?,1
403,ptsd,"I am wondering what experiences people have with using Mirtazapine as their main antidepressant for depressive and anxious symptoms (low energy, heavy feeling, irritability, concentration problems, insomnia, inability to complete mundane everyday tasks, social anxiety, fear of embarrassment, worry or overthinking about socialization, etc)?",1
404,ptsd,My depression/anxiety has been building over the past 3 months after a long remission period and due to current circumstances has nearly swung full steam over my everyday life.,1
405,ptsd,"I have the scars, medical records, injuries, memories, and nightmares.",1
406,ptsd,I know it's caused me to suffer from CPTSD.,1
407,ptsd,But has it caused me to lose my mind?,1
408,ptsd,I can't remember agreeing to dismiss.,1
409,ptsd,"I don't understand the response email, and I refuse to assign meaning by reading into her response.",1
410,ptsd,night sweats (bed stinks so bad and I have to wash the sheets daily and my bedroom is 68 degrees and I only sleep with sheets.),1
411,ptsd,night terrors (re-occuring dream: waking up with the feeling that I am supposed to tell someone something to prevent an awful occurrence from happening but unable to say the words.,1
412,ptsd,The words just won't come out) Wife scared to wake me up because I am fearfully jumpy and suffer from panic attacks upon awaking.,1
413,ptsd,depression,1
414,ptsd,I can't be having PTSD from something as mild as what happened even though I have pretty much all the symptoms.,1
415,ptsd,I feel I'm just lying to myself.,1
416,ptsd,I probably just want attention.,1
417,ptsd,"I feel like a huge fraud... How am I even supposed to ""heal"" when I'm probably making everything up, I'm probably not broken, I'm just going to get yelled at again at the new therapy place like my last one because I'll be mute every session (don't even know why, I tell myself ""because I'm not ready to talk about it"" but it's been over 5 years since the last case and all this crap is minor, so it's probably just being ashamed over doing all this crap for god-knows-why when barely anything happened to me...), because ""I'm not trying"".",1
418,ptsd,"I don't even know why I'm posting this, probably just begging for more attention, I've pushed the last true friend I had away a few days ago over my fears of therapy.",1
419,ptsd,"My memory goes, I panic, breakdown, rock back and forth, sit in closets.",1
420,ptsd,It sucks.,1
421,ptsd,But it's kind of relieving at the same time because while I'm broken I'm not choosing to be dramatic.,1
422,ptsd,I'm not just being manipulative.,1
423,ptsd,It's not my fault.,1
424,ptsd,I was sexually abused when I was a kid and I suspect that I have PTSD because of it.,1
425,ptsd,"I've never been diagnosed with PTSD, but I have been diagnosed with agoraphobia.",1
426,ptsd,I rarely leave my house.,1
427,ptsd,"I'm not really anxious about leaving my house and once I get somewhere, I'm usually fine.",1
428,ptsd,I just have a very strong feeling of not being able to leave my house.,1
429,ptsd,"On the off days where I don't remember them I still wake up feeling tired, wake up multiple times.",1
430,ptsd,I just feel like I cant sleep like normal.,1
431,ptsd,Ways to get out of the funk these put me in?,1
432,ptsd,It's really hurting.,1
433,ptsd,I just don't want to hurt anyone but I know deep down that it's me that's hurt.,1
434,ptsd,I really don't know what's wrong with me lately.,1
435,ptsd,It seems like every day I'm having some kind of meltdown and I don't know how to get back to normal.,1
436,ptsd,"The other night I had a massive flashback, no idea what triggered it.",1
437,ptsd,And for about two weeks now I feel constantly on the verge of an anxiety attack.,1
438,ptsd,I was a severe addict that had 2 overdoses when I was younger and addiction/alcoholism runs on both sides of my family.,1
439,ptsd,I don't want to come out of on the other side and be this nervous and uncomfortable person who is unable to have relationships.,1
440,ptsd,"I have been thinking of seeing a therapist, I don't really have the time or extra money, plus I've been really hurt from small intimate AA groups.... Ugh.... Is there another side of this PTSD mental attrition?",1
441,ptsd,"I'm not ready to talk about what happened, but it was pretty recent so even the small things are triggering.",1
442,ptsd,"I'm getting help, but these things take time and I can't just quit the internet.",1
443,ptsd,But it seems like I'm also dealing with abandonment issues with my parents which has recently reemerged after coming out as transgender which they don't support.,1
444,ptsd,"Unfortunately, I have Lyme disease and live with them because I'm too sick to do anything and they won't support my transition.",1
445,ptsd,I get the feeling that if I was healthy and I transitioned I'd never speak to them.,1
446,ptsd,I didn't know that either but I still felt the same.,1
447,ptsd,Also that whole living situation and that man was horrible and stressful anyway (without it being a trigger for something else too).,1
448,ptsd,Why did I open my mouth I should’ve just said “I’m fine” ~ I don’t need help Or maybe I do,1
449,ptsd,I really don't want to talk about what happened.,1
450,ptsd,"But, I really want the nightmares to go away.",1
451,ptsd,"Sorry if this sounds weird, I am really really fucking tired...",1
452,ptsd,I have complex ptsd due to past romantic relationships and some other various traumas in my life.,1
453,ptsd,"(Also diagnosed bipolar, severe social/general anxiety, OCPD) Currently suffering symptoms that and messing with my healthy thought patterns and its tearing apart my current relationship.",1
454,ptsd,I am terribly upset because this is the first partner to really take me as I am (dark side and all) The paranoid feeling that things are going to end has made it almost inevitable.,1
455,ptsd,"But now, I can't.",1
456,ptsd,I have completely given up on getting the correct mental health treatment.,1
457,ptsd,Even after he finished the exam he did another sweep with his hand idk wtf he was checking because we were all done I’m almost positive he just wanted to fucking touch me because every chance he could he would.,1
458,ptsd,"I was so close to tears I know this isn’t like so bad, but to a girl with ptsd from assault it was the end of the world.",1
459,ptsd,I felt so gross and grimy having his nasty hands on me calling me beautiful.,1
460,ptsd,"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories.",1
461,ptsd,And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating.,1
462,ptsd,I’m sorry.,1
463,ptsd,I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,1
464,ptsd,I know my thoughts are disorganized right now and I’m finding it hard to organize them.,1
465,ptsd,"“Fuck it, I’ll just microwave those fuckers and then give myself the decency to have a painless death.” “Ok ok, deep breaths.",1
466,ptsd,That completely threw me.,1
467,ptsd,I don't know why I'm finding it so difficult to cope.,1
468,ptsd,I'm crying frequently for some reason and I don't know why.,1
469,ptsd,I haven't done the whole uncontrollable crying thing since my last episode which was all the way back in November 2016.,1
470,ptsd,(I spent 2017 learning to shut down my emotions so crying had become a thing of the past.),1
471,ptsd,"I know he's never going to be the same, but it's hard seeing him like this.",1
472,ptsd,My brother lashes out when things don't go his way to and just has a nasty attitude at times..,1
473,ptsd,"Until recent years, I rarely got hugs from parents or my brother and when we'd brush legs while sitting, it'd be an awkward ""oh sorry"" and a shuffle to separate.",1
474,ptsd,I feel so worthless on those days.,1
475,ptsd,"I had PTSD for almost a year before going on benzos, but it wasn't until I was put on benzos (and then stupidly chose to continue a do-it-yourself habit) that my mind just happily dissociated - I barely remember the last year.",1
476,ptsd,What in the fuck have I done to myself?,1
477,ptsd,My husband had several things happen to him when he was a teenager and occasionally when things get very bad for him he has very bad flashbacks complete with regression to the time when the trauma happened.,1
478,ptsd,"It is heartbreaking to see, and obviously he does not recognize me and does not understand why we live together and why he’s not living at his parents house Does anyone have experience with this kind of flashbacks?",1

726,ptsd,"I had another friend come out and tap on my window, scaring me.",1
727,ptsd,"He didn’t know what happened, and when he asked me what was wrong I just started to cry.",1
728,ptsd,I felt stupid and ashamed.,1
729,ptsd,"Through the sobs I told him what happened, I even told him that my rapists did it to me.",1
730,ptsd,He was supportive and sweet and it made me feel so much more guilty.,1
731,ptsd,"Hi, I cannot think clearly today.",1
732,ptsd,"I know I have to take care of myself, but its always been an issue.",1
733,ptsd,"I do not shower, the last one was two months ago.",1
734,ptsd,I sleep in my clothes and wear them the next day.,1
735,ptsd,"I do not was my hands, or face.",1
736,ptsd,I literally felt her lose interest in talking to me as I said that.,1
737,ptsd,I told her that it wasnt a waste of my time and that I'm here because I want to get better.,1
738,ptsd,This was only my second time meeting her and we never delved into any of the main issues that I was facing but she brushed me off so quickly all because I wasn't sobbing my eyes out or felf like committing suicide.,1
739,ptsd,She acknowledged the fact that I wanted to stay and talk about other things in therapy but she proceeding to rush me out.,1
740,ptsd,"Here comes a little rant, because I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m done with it.",1
741,ptsd,I keep on having panic attacks and I can’t find the trigger.,1
742,ptsd,"I’ve been crying for hours now, and yesterday and the day before as well.",1
743,ptsd,"I’m seriously afraid that I will go nuts one day, I see no end nor a solution.",1
744,ptsd,I’m afraid I’ll end up in a mental hospital.,1
745,ptsd,"Since then, I've been more conscious of myself doing this and, while it feels like a shameful secret, I continue to do it.",1
746,ptsd,"I know I never did this before, so I'm wondering if it has anything to do with what happened to me.",1
747,ptsd,I feel like I'm the only one.,1
748,ptsd,"I've stopped telling it,  and when someone at work says what's wrong.",1
749,ptsd,I just can't really go out and do stuff.,1
750,ptsd,I keep pushing college back I wanted to be a nurse and now I don't want to do anything but be a hermit and go live in the woods.,1
751,ptsd,"I'm not really looking for responses I'm just tired of people not listening or believing me, I've had it all my life and I'm just done with it.",1
752,ptsd,But I digress.,1
753,ptsd,"In February of this year, I was raped by my (now ex) boyfriend, who also happened to be the only person I've ever had sex with.",1
754,ptsd,I was diagnosed with PTSD in September.,1
755,ptsd,"The rape has flipped my life entirely upside down, and there isn't an hour that goes by where my mind doesn't screw me over with either thoughts of the rape itself or simply just HIM.",1
756,ptsd,And I don't even remember.,1
757,ptsd,He says it's ok and he forgives me.,1
758,ptsd,But it's NOT OKAY.,1
759,ptsd,my diagnoses and the symptoms of it is never an excuse to hurt the ones I love.,1
760,ptsd,But my brain defaulted into my stoned embarrassment.,1
761,ptsd,"Just having this idea people hate me when they don’t, missing my dad and punishing myself for not being able to help my dad through his alcoholism.",1
762,ptsd,Not that he deserves it.,1
763,ptsd,But raping my mom was one of those.,1
764,ptsd,"But damn, I felt really inferior.",1
765,ptsd,"My friends are branching off and doing amazing things, and I feel I’m in the corner just trying to make it through the day, constantly dealing with chronic pain, low immunity, and PTSD.",1
766,ptsd,I’m just having a rough time tonight.,1
767,ptsd,"My counsellor saw me through the window and called me on the phone, trying to distract me so she could send help over to me.",1
768,ptsd,"Campus was pretty much empty, everyone in exams or already finished for the summer and I felt at peace.",1
769,ptsd,Now I’m wishing I didn’t.,1
770,ptsd,"Called two of my friends, but it’s late and they’re asleep.",1
771,ptsd,But this incident has been troubling me for a couple of days now.,1
772,ptsd,I guess I am just sick and tired of my trauma interfering with my relationships.,1
773,ptsd,I feel bad for my boyfriend- he shouldn't have to put up with this stuff.,1
774,ptsd,I know he loves me and he is terribly worried.,1
775,ptsd,But I also feel bad for me.,1
776,ptsd,"I'm not sure why he thinks I want to erode their relationship, this is another thing I'm still thinking about.",1
777,ptsd,This is sorta horrifying to think about because I have absolutely zero romantic interest in him at all and the reason I valued our friendship so much in the first place was because there was no romantic/sexual element.,1
778,ptsd,"I was nice, and it got me no where, so I was rude, it got worse.",1
779,ptsd,"I compliment my mom and my sister as much as I can, I tell my sister I’m proud of her, I tell both of them I love them, I take care of my mom the best I can, but I’m still their verbal punching bag.",1
780,ptsd,"Every day I tell my mom that I love her, that she looks pretty, etc etc, but it ends up in her replying with “you’re gonna fail this year you know that right?",1
781,ptsd,My sister called me naive and immature for not making fun of people’s interests and looks.,1
782,ptsd,Please don't make me feel worse.,1
783,ptsd,"I mean, hell, I'm ashamed I even need to ask my boyfriend.",1
784,ptsd,My mom and sister either do nothing or make it worse.,1
785,ptsd,"My father would abuse me consistently both mentally and physically from i think 4 to 14, maybe earlier.",1
786,ptsd,"I don't really remember what all brought this on, but often it was school related.",1
787,ptsd,"I remember being in a car seat, my mother didn't know what to do so she took me to him (my parents are apart), and i tried to run because i knew what was going to happen, and i remember crying so hard i hyperventilated, my mom promised never to do that again.",1
788,ptsd,"He'd do it because of grades, because i misbehaved.",1
789,ptsd,"And I freak out when staff at the library call cops over us ""being loud"", I freak out over some very minor warrants.",1
790,ptsd,While waiting & the drop in center for the shower she assaults me & I block her blows.,1
791,ptsd,"im so scared of everything around me, whenever I have a panic attack, I can't even call out for help, I just choke on my own breath and cry im just fearful of what's going to happen in the future.",1
792,ptsd,"I'm already seeing a therapist but i've been relapsing so bad since september and i just don't know what to do it's been such a rollercoaster and it just feels hopeless to recover from this im sorry for bothering you guys i just need to talk.. everyone i can talk to is asleep and i wouldnt be able to talk to them even if I could, i feel so numb after the panic attack i had last night, i just..",1
793,ptsd,"Need a talk, a distraction or something, because right now I just feel so.",1
794,ptsd,wrong and out of place,1
795,ptsd,I don't remember everything but i tried to lie to him and he had to drag me to the bathroom and tried to make me throw up.,1
796,ptsd,"The scary thing is that when he went to call the ambulance and i thought i just might die i repeated to myself ""It's finally over"".",1
797,ptsd,I feel afraid to work.,1
798,ptsd,I feel like less of a man because of this.,1
799,ptsd,I worry about my future and if I'll ever get stable ground.,1
800,ptsd,"I don't have any point, I'm just overwhelmed and want to give up.",1
801,ptsd,"I don't want to tell my therapist, I don't want to go to therapy.",1
802,ptsd,It feels artificial and contrived and uneven.,1
803,ptsd,It's sick and twisted.,1
804,ptsd,I've been getting nauseas and I've been having more dissociative flashbacks.,1
805,ptsd,"My nightmares are coming back, but they're mostly of his parents.",1
806,ptsd,"I'm afraid to see them, although my dreams are usually them telling me they understand.",1
807,ptsd,it wasn't my fault it feels like my fault I feel like the reason That mother shouldn't have had to bury her boy I should have been a better friend,1
808,ptsd,But then i couldn't think straight.,1
809,ptsd,now i get flashbacks in school.,1
810,ptsd,"I used to enjoy quantitative courses but now i get tension headaches from the flashbacks, and feelings of horror and hyperarousal.",1
811,ptsd,I just feel so violated and disturbed that it was for fear of his violence that i didn't close the door - and that he was watching me!,1
812,ptsd,"My vagina feels tension too, which i read from a PTSD book is a common symptom.",1
813,ptsd,They would text and call constantly throughout the day begging me to forgive them for hurting me but that  they're in love and love can't be stopped.,1
814,ptsd,They got increasingly angry and started calling me selfish for trying to keep them apart.,1
815,ptsd,After I wrote a bit about the sexual abuse in an anonymous online diary my ex (who knew my username but I thought I had blocked from the site) started harassing me more.,1
816,ptsd,Angrily telling me that I need to stop pretending he raped me and how I wanted everything that happened and that I was just a jealous ex.,1
817,ptsd,"I won't and kinda can't (remember missing pieces of time) go into all the details, but he gaslighted me pretty bad.",1
818,ptsd,Sometimes I'll stop and just stand somewhere or stare until I get snapped out of it.,1
819,ptsd,When I dissociate it's usually a lot more violent and delusional so I thought maybe it was something else.,1
820,ptsd,"I haven't brought it up with my therapist because I just had a meeting with her before learning about this, am I just looking too deep into things?",1
821,ptsd,I only get it when I have a flashback or strong reaction to a trigger.,1
822,ptsd,Also been having lots of nightmares again recently.,1
823,ptsd,"Not sure what to do as I’m not currently in therapy, but I am waiting to be seen at a mental health clinic.",1
824,ptsd,I go through periods where all night I have nightmares and I can’t slee because of them.,1
825,ptsd,"Three years ago I used to be on a medicine that helped with the nightmares, I can’t remember the name though.",1
826,ptsd,But it made me so tired.,1
827,ptsd,My version of events wasn't believed due to ten other witnesses denying it and I was expelled immediately.,1
828,ptsd,I got home and unexpectedly my bags were already packed.,1
829,ptsd,"I'm waiting to tell work about what happened, that I can't come in.",1
830,ptsd,I'm going to the hospital with her.,1
831,ptsd,I don't care if they're mad or if I get fired.,1
832,ptsd,I just feel so shaken and scared still.,1
833,ptsd,I feel like I've taken a giant step back.,1
834,ptsd,"The subsequent criminal trial has made me question my emotional stability, and memories.",1
835,ptsd,"Are the symptoms of CPTSD causing me to fail in my interactions on a day to day basis, or has there simply been a bizarre miscommunication?",1
836,ptsd,I wish I could go back and just not fuck up so horribly.,1
837,ptsd,I was begged not to go out on this date from tinder.,1
838,ptsd,My friend was raped off tinder and told me all guys want are sex off tinder.,1
839,ptsd,I had talked to my assaulter and told him I didn't want to be touched and he was fine with it and seemed perfectly normal.,1
840,ptsd,I'm so stupid.,1
841,ptsd,"I'm new to Reddit and have only really discussed my issues with trauma and PTSD with my partner and therapist, and I am struggling with the random dissociative cycles of derealization and depersonalization.",1
842,ptsd,And I'm so tired of it.,1
843,ptsd,I've been in therapy for half of my life.,1
844,ptsd,"I write and also listen to music to help when I'm having issues, but it never feels like enough.",1
845,ptsd,So I started talking to myself (which I do under stress) and drinking and this was a piece of the conversation:,1
846,ptsd,I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.,1
847,ptsd,It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion.,1
848,ptsd,I know most of you will say ‘you need to leave’ or something obvious - yes I know.,1
849,ptsd,"But things aren’t that easy and than there’s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he, of all people, will change.",1
850,ptsd,I'm afraid of going into too much detail only because I constantly fear that he knows that I talk about him.,1
851,ptsd,"To keep it short, my father was physically violent towards me, my mother, our dog, mistreated all of his animals, leaked our information on shady sites before multiple times, and has made my life a living hell up until I went to court to stop having visitation with him.",1
852,ptsd,"I thought that it wouldn't really affect anything outside of startle reflex, trust issues, etc, but here I am years after my last visit with him and it's still affecting me fucking terribly.",1
853,ptsd,I just sat in bed sobbing for a half hour because I'm afraid of everyone around me.,1
854,ptsd,I'm assuming I have PTSD and my work gave me a number to call and I'm debating doing so.,1
855,ptsd,But I hate asking for help and I feel pathetic because nothing happened.,1
856,ptsd,I'm physically fine.,1
857,ptsd,I just really need advice because I'm struggling on how to feel.,1
858,ptsd,I don't know why I can't just brush this off considering I'm alright.,1
859,ptsd,"However, today I was sitting at work and for whatever reason I started thinking about the knife incident.",1
860,ptsd,"It was a pretty stupid thing to think about, it caused the worst panic attack I've had in months and had to go for a walk around the block to clear my head.",1
861,ptsd,I don't want to feel like a burden to anyone anymore and to myself so the feeling of wanting to die didn't go away.,1
862,ptsd,I don't know how to deal with myself or with other people since I feel like I should just get over it and continue with my life but I can't and I'm 22.,1
863,ptsd,Am I exaggerating?,1
864,ptsd,Am I just so weak that I can't deal with what happened to me that I can't normally continue with my life?,1
865,ptsd,I feel like I'm at the end of my rope here.,1
866,ptsd,I bawl every night because I don't want to feel this never ending pain anymore.,1
867,ptsd,I can't live with what happen to me.,1
868,ptsd,I can't live with the fact that since I didn't go to police that he is preying on another girl like me.,1
869,ptsd,I have so many social problems I dont have friends anymore.,1
870,ptsd,I’m so concerned as we head into warmer months.,1
871,ptsd,"I know I need to leave the area and that’s on my agenda, I just can’t do that before summer comes and goes.",1
872,ptsd,But even the ride from home to office is enough to send me into a spin for about an hour.,1
873,ptsd,"Without my boyfriend who I thought was my best friend, my two female friends who used to always have my back becoming distant, and now not knowing who or what to trust seeing as Nex and I still work in the same industry my PTSD is just skyrocketing off the charts.",1
874,ptsd,"With no roots put back down yet (which I’m working on the living sit) and no one close to turn to emotionally, how the fuck do I go on?",1
875,ptsd,When is enough enough?,1
876,ptsd,When is it too much?,1
877,ptsd,I know giving up is not an option but it is all so overwhelming...,1
878,ptsd,"When it's abuse in the workplace, it seems like everyone just says, ""Oh, get over it, and don't be a baby.",1
879,ptsd,I don't know one other person who goes through shit like this at work or who acts like that - WTF?).,1
880,ptsd,"They just want to brush it off, and no one gives a shit.",1
881,ptsd,Does anyone else experience parts of their PTSD this way?,1
882,ptsd,I tried to do some digging and pin down what I am experiencing so I can communicate with my husband more effectively but it isn't something that seems to fit nicely into a box and so it has been confusing.,1
883,ptsd,"I pushed through and finished my PhD, but now I'm worn, and after looking into it, I've realized that the psychological symptoms of stress I display are closely aligned with racism-specific PTSD.",1
884,ptsd,"I've been through psychotherapy, but I'm not sure the therapist was adequately prepared to identify it, but I know for certain that I have PTSD.",1
885,ptsd,I want to begin healing now that I'm done with grad school.,1
886,ptsd,From the moment I wake up and until I go to sleep I don't feel safe.,1
887,ptsd,When I'm around other people I feel even even more anxious/fearful.,1
888,ptsd,"I know nothing bad is going to happen to me, but I still feel this way.",1
889,ptsd,"I don't really have any friends, and these intense chronic feelings makes it seem impossible to make a real connection with anyone.",1
890,ptsd,I have been considering finally confessing my secret because it feels like I am choking on it.,1
891,ptsd,"I repress it as much as I can, but when it bubbles to the surface, it effects everything in my life.",1
892,ptsd,I need help and I need to find the right way to deal and approach this.,1
893,ptsd,i was sexually assaulted almost 6 months ago.,1
894,ptsd,once i was assaulted i ate nothing for three days straight.,1
895,ptsd,i couldn’t stop losing the weight.,1
896,ptsd,"A couple months after we though she was out of our lives, she broke into our house at 2 am.",1
897,ptsd,"I was playing diablo 2, as at this point in my life I had severe insomnia.",1
898,ptsd,"Had i not been up, My dad had thought I had broken a cup or something and wasnt going to bother checking, I was known for having insomnia at this point in my life already, so she may very well have attacked any one of us that night.",1
899,ptsd,I feel like I've failed.,1
900,ptsd,I keep having this fear that I've made it all up.,1
901,ptsd,"That I made up the rape, and made up the traumatizing feelings, made up the emotions.",1
902,ptsd,"I'm afraid that I just have a very sick, sick dramatic mind that is just making up terrible shit to try and destroy me or something?",1
903,ptsd,But then I get angry so quickly and I feel terrible because I snapped at someone who didn’t deserve it and I just don’t understand where it comes from.,1
904,ptsd,"Or I’ll suddenly start thinking about what happened to me and I’ll get really really depressed, again out of nowhere.",1
905,ptsd,One minute I’m functioning okay and the next I seem like someone else.,1
906,ptsd,I don’t know if this is a symptom of my PTSD or if there’s something else mentally wrong with me that’s being piled on top of the PTSD.,1
907,ptsd,I was just recently diagnosed so I guess I’m still trying to figure out what’s the PTSD and what’s just me losing my mind.,1
908,ptsd,"So im m15 im still in school ive been through abuse when i was a kid it scarred my head i live with my mum now but i usually roam in woods playing guitar, i got diagnosed when i was 14 shit sucks gives me flashbacks whenever i close my eyes, my mind scans every goddamn thing in the area every fucking thing!, i just dont know how to explain its so complicated my brain acts weird at times i just need to know wtf is happening with me!",1
909,ptsd,"My mom never threw books at me, but the impact of something along with the name-calling was enough.",1
910,ptsd,I ran to my room and I honestly don't remember what I did.,1
911,ptsd,"I remember my attack going on for hours, but everything else is blurry.",1
912,ptsd,"I'm scared, and I've been on edge for the past few days.",1
913,ptsd,"My ex is claiming self-defense, even though I wasn't attacking him.",1
914,ptsd,"I'm way too small of a person, it doesn't even make sense.",1
915,ptsd,"He towers over me, how does he expect people to believe him?",1
916,ptsd,"No wonder I get scolded for bad grades, called a lazy, worthless piece of fuck because I am too lazy or too stupid to care about exams and my future, but in reality, I deeply care too much as if I feel like the whole fucking world of 7 billion people, and millions or billions of other organisms are on my shoulders ... and all I can do is to shut down entirely.",1
917,ptsd,"I shut down by brain, my thoughts, my emotions, everything because I cannot take all the anxiety.",1
918,ptsd,All the fear and terror.,1
919,ptsd,Sometimes I feel as depressed as if I am a lonely guy in a post-apocalyptic setting where everyone is either dead or absent or gone.,1
920,ptsd,I’m going to kill myself.,1
921,ptsd,I can’t take this anymore.,1
922,ptsd,"I was doing so much fucking better lately, and just like a snap of a finger, I am disassociating harder then I ever have before.",1
923,ptsd,"It comes out of nowhere, when I’m having an other wise good day.",1
924,ptsd,No anxiety or depression but out of nowhere I get extremely disassociated.,1
925,ptsd,"I loved this person dearly with all my heart, and it was an extremly tragic and sudden death.",1
926,ptsd,I want to go to my doctor but im already in counceling.,1
927,ptsd,"My stress tolerance was already at a zero and I was contemplating suicide a lot, i didn’t want to see where that would lead me and I didn’t want to do that to my brothers.",1
928,ptsd,"He’s helping me through the problems of getting rehabilitation welfare, which is a hassle because I constantly have to talk to new counselors, psychologists and psychiatrists which triggers breakdowns.",1
929,ptsd,"I hate talking about myself to strangers, I’m not ashamed at all, I just hate having to share how I truly feel with strangers.",1
930,ptsd,I self harm sometimes too.,1
931,ptsd,"I’ve also lately begun to have constant, daily, and explicit nightmares about tarantulas, roaches, and beetles crawling over me while I’m paralyzed.",1
932,ptsd,"I’m asking bc I don’t want the therapist to yell at me or call me a liar like the last few did, so I’m low key nervous and I don’t want to get in any more trouble with my school.",1
933,ptsd,"Its hard knowing that everyone around you doesn't have these issues, It's hard that it takes an extreme amount of work just to make a normal day in life go by smoothly(which it almost never does) At first I felt like I had a grasps on this whole PTSD thing because it made sense when I first got diagnosed but the longer it's been the harder this is to deal with.",1
934,ptsd,Do you know what it's like to constantly feel uncomfortable in your own skin but you can never turn it off?,1
935,ptsd,"I find myself drinking more than i'd like to admit,I never drank before this, anything to take the edge off.",1
936,ptsd,"I feel like I'm having to teach myself everything all over again, I don't even know how to formulate that into words.",1
937,ptsd,I am worried that I may have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder due to a few notable symptoms/issues that I experience.,1
938,ptsd,"(I also have one notable traumatic experience involving an accident my father was in, he got hit by a bus when I was seventeen and almost died, which I do have nightmares and flashbacks of, but that is a different story.)",1
939,ptsd,"Some days I can't hear music from that time period, watch a show that's remotely emotional, or just sit without tearing up.",1
940,ptsd,"I've never been to see a shrink, although I know I should of, due to past experiences and money issues.",1
941,ptsd,I was diagnosed with PTSD and told I should talk to someone.,1
942,ptsd,I don't know where to go usually.,1
943,ptsd,Especially on nights like these where I can't be quiet without thinking about that night or breaking down in tears.,1
944,ptsd,It made me feel so... small.,1
945,ptsd,"After I left, I felt angry, really fucking angry.",1
946,ptsd,"I don't want to call the office and make a fuss, I want it behind me.",1
947,ptsd,I'm just angry that someone could really think that way.,1
948,ptsd,I'm angry.,1
949,ptsd,I had a panic attack and broke down crying in front of my mom.,1
950,ptsd,She scheduled me an appointment for therapy and I just feel like bleh.,1
951,ptsd,I dont care about getting better right now.,1
952,ptsd,My whole body is in shock from that panic attack and I just feel like death.,1
953,ptsd,I honestly doubt I will get better,1
954,ptsd,"I am no longer ashamed of what happened to me, but I still don't feel like I'm healing.",1
955,ptsd,"I was hoping that these flashbacks and the anxiety, fear and dread would go away over time, but they haven't.",1
956,ptsd,I made a mistake as a result of being shaken up.,1
957,ptsd,Now she has complained to my boss but has falsely amplified my one mistake into me being absolutely negligent and incompetent.,1
958,ptsd,"I found out about this 8 hours ago, had another flashback/panic attack, and my heart is still pounding.",1
959,ptsd,I've convinced myself I'm going to get fired.,1
960,ptsd,I know I need to go back to counseling.,1
961,ptsd,And it literally makes me feel 10k x crazier than I already feel as it is.,1
962,ptsd,"She left me alone, meds unfilled, and then told all her colleagues I was trying to scam ADHD medication off of her, so now none of them want to take my case either.",1
963,ptsd,"They’re like flashbacks and everything I hated that he did , I want this new person to do to me to the point where I break down again.",1
964,ptsd,What the fuck is wrong with me please.,1
965,ptsd,These are violent degrading fantasies and they make me feel like a really disturbed person.,1
966,ptsd,The thought after an orgasm literally makes me cry.,1
967,ptsd,"Dealing with ptsd from rape, and recently found out that someone who I thought was a friend sexually assaulted one of our friends at a party we were at.",1
968,ptsd,"I get flashbacks of waking up whenever we were at parties together and I've seen him awake once or twice and even though the likelyhood is very low (given the background of what he did), I can't shake the feeling that he mightve done something to me.",1
969,ptsd,What he did to her is giving me feelings like what happened to her was actually me.,1
970,ptsd,I'm scared I'm going to slip the next time I get in the car or on my motorcycle and just plow into something at full speed just because it'd be so easy and it might end all the pain.,1
971,ptsd,I don't have a gun.,1
972,ptsd,"I'm 20 years old and suffer with PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and Insomnia.",1
973,ptsd,But my biggest struggle is my PTSD.,1

975,ptsd,I remember everything so vividly.,1
976,ptsd,But i don't really want to get into all that right now.,1
977,ptsd,"And in the 10 years since my emancipation, I've only watched my cognitive state decline.",1
978,ptsd,I've been agoraphobic for 3 years now.,1
979,ptsd,3 years ago I moved into the shelter system after a domestic dispute triggered my agoraphobia again.,1

985,ptsd,"Having expected that, I told myself at the time that it doesn't bother me much and I'll go back to handling it all by myself as I've been doing for years, but it's been nagging at me for most of the day now.",1
986,ptsd,I keep doubting whether I really am wallowing in it.,1
987,ptsd,"My trauma occured five years ago, and it doesn't bother me anywhere near as much as it used to (thanks to some tricks I learned on here and through my own research), and I believe I've been handling it all okay.",1
988,ptsd,"I do my level best not to dwell on it, I've accepted it's in the past and will never happen again...except that doesn't stop the flashbacks and nightmares.",1
989,ptsd,"I wasn't directly involved in my traumatic events, I only saw and heard them.",1
990,ptsd,"I haven't ever been triggered by my grandma(until now) and even though it made me upset I had a ""well, it could be worse"" mentality.",1
991,ptsd,So yesterday my grandma got mad.,1
992,ptsd,Really mad.,1
993,ptsd,"She started screaming at me, calling me names, and then threw a book at me.",1
994,ptsd,This triggered the trauma from my mom.,1

1002,ptsd,Not sure why but I’m really off today.,1
1003,ptsd,I can’t stop feeling like a screw up even though I’ve really done nothing wrong today.,1
1004,ptsd,I feel like it might have been triggered by seeing an old family friend who asked how my abuser was or because I am having an injury flare up after doing really well.,1
1005,ptsd,I just feel useless and unlovable.,1
1006,ptsd,I have convinced myself even my husband doesn’t like me.,1
1007,ptsd,Just for some reason recently I have been struggling more and more to just suck it up and carry on.,1
1008,ptsd,"I don't trust anyone, especially myself.",1
1009,ptsd,I am going fucking crazy.,1
1010,ptsd,I feel there's really only 3 conclusions to my life currently.,1

1013,ptsd,The thoughts that have been pouring into my head theses past few days are terrifying.,1
1014,ptsd,I wonder what driving my car off the side of the freeway would feel like.,1
1015,ptsd,I feel so hopeless & I don't want to feel this way anymore.,1

1018,ptsd,Apparently she also dissociates during this time and she doesn't remember anything afterwards.,1
1019,ptsd,It breaks my heart to see this but it also kind of scares me.,1
1020,ptsd,"I was in my front yard talking to him on the phone, when I refused to hang-up she had a temper tantrum and screamed loudly enough for the people outside to hear her say I ""got online and talked to little boys.""",1

1029,ptsd,"I went from being this pretty normal looking student, short cropped hair, I would wear normal casual clothing on weekends, I was healthy, all that, now, over three years later I look completely different, I'm stick thin, hair grown out past my shoulders, I only wear black and almost always clothes that cover as much of me as possible, heavy scarring covering the majority of my body, and messy facial hair growing in.",1
1030,ptsd,"I feel like I've completely altered myself so nobody is tempted to hurt me again, like I'm blaming how I looked for what happened, so completely changing it seemed like the most sensible thing.",1
1031,ptsd,"But I’m pissed, I waited to long for this like I honestly could have killed myself before they got back to me.",1
1032,ptsd,"I know there’s a lot of people in the system and their funding is low, but this is bullshit!",1
1033,ptsd,The government doesn’t give a shit about mentally ill people.,1
1034,ptsd,If they did then there honestly would be way less crime rates and suicide rate because people would be getting the help that they need instead of waiting for some bad shit to happen before they get help.,1
1035,ptsd,The urgency is just NOT there at all.,1
1036,ptsd,"I don’t know how long it continues for but he died when I was 10/12 or so Around this time I was also severely bullied in school, my cousin being the ring leader.",1

1042,ptsd,"Take my hand and just understand I need their company to stop the war in my head, but torn because they say I should be able to do that for myself..",1
1043,ptsd,I also have pretty bad dissociative episodes which I've had since I was about 5.,1
1044,ptsd,Because I've gotten to a point in my life where I'm so run down that I just can't anymore.,1
1045,ptsd,I don't know if I should even bother going up in dose or if it's just another waste of energy,1
1046,ptsd,How could I when I felt so unwelcome?,1
1047,ptsd,"Idk, I'm sorry, I'm just so sick of carrying on when it's so fucking exhausting just to be told that it's never bloody fucking good enough for anyone.",1

1054,ptsd,Ever sense I was 9 or 10 I knew I would die by my own hand.,1
1055,ptsd,I need to see a therapist but I don't know what to do.,1
1056,ptsd,I can't teach my therapists how to do their job nor should I feel like I need to in the first place.,1
1057,ptsd,I also have chronic illnesses which makes it tiring (if not at times impossible) to have to constantly fight back against all my doctors to make sure they actually treat me and my symptoms and not just the numbers on my chart.,1
1058,ptsd,It's gotten to the point where I'm really pessimistic about getting better or even being able to get good help.,1
1059,ptsd,I'm starting to really believe that my brain is the problem here and not trauma.,1
1060,ptsd,"Everyone just thinks I'm a dramatic slut anyway, so does it even matter?",1
1061,ptsd,I feel like I'm too embarrassed to even go back to my psych now.,1

1063,ptsd,"When you can’t remember the simplest things, but your mind is racing a thousand miles a minute, you know it can’t go on.",1
1064,ptsd,It felt like my sanity was whirling away from me.,1
1065,ptsd,"So I arrived in what I remember to be a thatch of poisonous thorns, ripe with painful, tearful memories.",1
1066,ptsd,"When I was younger, not even double digits, another minor around my age came very close to sexually assaulting me.",1
1067,ptsd,"Years later, I couldn’t be around men without feeling anxious.",1
1068,ptsd,"I don’t remember having any nightmares but, I couldn’t trust men.",1
1069,ptsd,Not even my own father.,1
1070,ptsd,"I instantly thought of something I rarely think about, being molested in a pool locker room when I was 10.",1
1071,ptsd,My heart started beating incredibly fast as I readied myself to tell them the thing I couldn’t even tell my family at the time.,1
1072,ptsd,"I started crying, something I haven’t done in years and something my friends have never seen me do.",1
1073,ptsd,"When it got to me, with my hand over my eyes all I could say was “I don’t think I can”.",1
1074,ptsd,"It felt like I was reliving what I’d gone through, like I could see it happening in front of me.",1
1075,ptsd,"The misery is so much worse than pre-lamictal, the torment is so much scarier.",1
1076,ptsd,"It feels almost demonic, like someone outside of me is tormenting me (I do not mean this literally or psychotically, it's just my subjective description).",1
1077,ptsd,"I have crying spells all day, I mean the entire day, doesn't matter who I'm hanging out with, doesn't matter if I'm at work (I had to quit for the time being), doesn't matter if I'm working out.",1
1078,ptsd,"I shake and cry and shake and cry, like wailing violent cries.",1
1079,ptsd,"It's terrifying, it feels very ""chemical"" and out of control, like the absence of the drug does this to me, and it's scary for the people around me.",1
1080,ptsd,It sent me into a full-blown crisis by breaking open the “no one believes me and I’m worthless” wound.,1
1081,ptsd,It was the most physically symptomatic I’ve ever been in-session.,1
1082,ptsd,"Whenever I have a reaction or meltdown, he always tries to give shitty advice like ""just think about the things you're grateful for.""",1
1083,ptsd,"I'm sorry, but in the therapies I've taken and in the books I have to help me, nothing *anywhere* says anything about gratitude and it tends to trigger me when he says this because it's what my narcy mom would say to me.",1
1084,ptsd,"I tried to explain this and asked him to read my books and he got mad at me because in his mind I was trying to tell him what to do and I was being ""ungrateful"" for his help.",1
1085,ptsd,"I told him how important it was to me for him to read these books because it would help me feel more understood, but he keeps coming up with excuse after excuse about why he doesn't want to read them.",1
1086,ptsd,I just don't know what to do anymore.,1
1087,ptsd,I wanted to snap her clueless little head off.,1
1088,ptsd,"Or at the very least, tell her to shut the f$*( up.",1
1089,ptsd,I am just sick of this being my daily life.,1
1090,ptsd,Between the derealization and the hypervigilance and paranoia even on good days I still don't feel like a person - and that's not even touching the flashbacks and nightmares.,1
1091,ptsd,I don't know what to do anymore.,1
1092,ptsd,"I can't find a shrink who I trust or who seems equipped to help with the particular symptoms I have, and that seems like my only option.",1
1093,ptsd,"I feel that because I put myself in that situation, I sort of don't deserve help if that makes sense.",1
1094,ptsd,"Now boyfriend is back to bed, and I'm assuming I'll be up for the rest of the night.",1
1095,ptsd,I don't know what to do with this.,1
1096,ptsd,I don't have the ability to cope with it anymore.,1
1097,ptsd,"I'm trying, but a lot of things are triggering me, and I'm shutting down at work, just finding the place I feel safest, and staying there for an hour or two until I feel like I can do something again.",1
1098,ptsd,"I'm tired of watching my back, tired of traveling to places I don't feel safe, tired of reliving that moment, tired of being triggered, tired of the stress, tired of anxiety and knots in my stomach, tired of irrational thought when triggered, tired of irrational paranoia.",1
1099,ptsd,"I'm exhausted and need a break, but know it won't be enough until I journey the long road through therapy.",1
1100,ptsd,"I'm not suicidal at all, just wishing this pain and misery would end, to have my life back again.",1
1101,ptsd,Her trauma was worse than mine but she didn't develop PTSD.,1
1102,ptsd,"(My mom has no idea I even had a traumatic event) I told her it's not that easy, and she said it just needs to be done.",1
1103,ptsd,Now I am scared.,1
1104,ptsd,"With a switch blade and open arms In a sweater vest that covers a ragged undershirt stained with my innocence Through faces that are never the same as the ones I dread finding in the crowd In the night, I rediscover my love of mares and how hoarse I can be in the morning It's the taste of blood but I am not bleeding",1
1105,ptsd,"I feel so validated every time I leave his office, like someone actually understands what I'm struggling with, and I don't have to convince them of my mental illness.",1
1106,ptsd,"Just before the second birth, she kind of lunged towards our first kid in the road, which, we later learned, gave her symphysis pubis dysfunction <url> She actually had substantial back/neck/joint pain (more on this later) in the first pregnancy as well, and this was worse, causing her to need crutches for the remainder of the pregnancy.",1
1107,ptsd,"During the pregnancy and after the (traumatic) birth of our first child in 2013, symptoms started to intensify, including lots of depression, some manic behavior, and periodic angry outbursts.",1
1108,ptsd,i remember her getting drunk and and ranting about a fuck buddy she was angry at.,1
1109,ptsd,Trauma survivors often don’t need more awareness.,1
1110,ptsd,They need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them.,1
1111,ptsd,"At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame.",1
1112,ptsd,"Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved.",1
1113,ptsd,They live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right.,1
1114,ptsd,I do not blame her at all for this behaviour but I really need help understanding her before I get hurt worse than I already have.,1
1115,ptsd,To stop a feeling of rage: Stand straight with your feet apart.,1
1116,ptsd,It's good to not feel alone.,1
1117,ptsd,TL;DR I sometimes feel like I'm faking having PTSD despite never expecting I had it and then getting an official diagnosis from a doctor.,1
1118,ptsd,I feel like I'm starting to get the control back over my life slowly.,1
1119,ptsd,I finnaly have hope and I could hardly ask for more.,1
1120,ptsd,"I asked my doc to lower my Effexor because I feel like the the side-effects outweigh the good it does: It doesn't really help much for my anxiety, I feel depersonalization ever since I'm on medications and finally it gives me uncontrollable cravings.",1
1121,ptsd,He killed his best friend twice (technically) and his wife died along with most everyone he knew.,1
1122,ptsd,"I'm fine, or so I thought.",1
1123,ptsd,"All my issues with anger, alcohol abuse, frequent bouts of depression, difficulties focusing or concentrating at work, I attributed to my bipolar disorder, and that was all I worked on.",1
1124,ptsd,"I didn't think that talking about anything would affect my bipolar disorder, and I **really** didn't want to talk about my trauma.",1
1125,ptsd,Then I suddenly looked up toward the door and entirely expected my fellow student to burst in yelling about how I told our advisor.,1
1126,ptsd,I'm pretty broke and almost all of my money for now is going towards bills and food.,1
1127,ptsd,I'm hesitant to start a regimen of anxiety medications if it's possible to work through things.,1
1128,ptsd,This week we began to work through my trauma.,1
1129,ptsd,"It is crazy how DEEP these emotional scars and wounds are, that I literally cried way harder in this session, than in even processing waking up in a hospital bald!",1
1130,ptsd,"In this memory, I had post-partum depression right after my son was born and was living with Nmom and my Edad when they were still married 8 years ago.",1
1131,ptsd,i also felt someone sit on my bed next to me when i tried to leave the light off and sleep.,1
1132,ptsd,i distinctly felt it.,1
1133,ptsd,So many people have it worse than I do.,1
1134,ptsd,"This is where the therapist is openly punitive, hostile or withholding, explicitly, in order to punish and teach you.",1
1135,ptsd,Plus I know filing a claim at the VA is humiliating and I don’t want to go though what others I fear have.,1
1136,ptsd,I won’t have to make that decision to either shut up and let him have his way or or risk my safety and the safety of my family.,1
1137,ptsd,"I’m not bound to him anymore, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t panic at the end of each day in the split second that I think it’s going to happen again.",1
1138,ptsd,"I’m an adult now, not a child that was groomed and broken like a horse.",1
1139,ptsd,I’ll never have to ask if I’m allowed to put on my clothes and leave.,1
1140,ptsd,&#x200B; I've been close to killing myself 3 times.,1
1141,ptsd,"Edit: She has seen a therapist that diagnosed her with PTSD based on a fear of tornadoes (that she has never been directly affected by other than her parent, father, having them go into a basement as one was nearby).",1
1142,ptsd,"It started again, but worse.",1
1143,ptsd,I'd bring up the conversation we had and he'd ask how dare I call him names.,1
1144,ptsd,"How dare I, he said.",1
1145,ptsd,"So, on September 7th, I decided that I had enough.",1
1146,ptsd,I cut him out of my life.,1
1147,ptsd,The place where I was going for therapy decided that they couldn't appropriately treat me.,1
1148,ptsd,I've had a tough time finding another therapist.,1
1149,ptsd,The strange thing is I've been feeling better out of therapy then when I was in it.,1
1150,ptsd,I went twice a week and it felt like my whole life revolved around trauma.,1
1151,ptsd,So I'm feeling a bit lost with this.,1
1152,ptsd,I've had asthma ever since I was a little kid and it has been flaring up really bad over the last few weeks...,1
1153,ptsd,I still do when Gramma isn’t listening.,1
1154,ptsd,And everyone was passive aggressive.,1
1155,ptsd,The manager tried to peg down my salary multiple times like a fucking haggler at a market.,1
1156,ptsd,"The passive aggressive shit really got to me, and then I realized that I was being illegally paid.",1
1157,ptsd,"Extensive martial arts background has turned negative adrenalized states from inward, depressive vulnerability to external, physical reactivity.",1
1158,ptsd,I describe it as feeling like I'm in a fight (physiologically) though I am sitting still or trying to sleep.,1
1159,ptsd,"Loss of fine motor skills, hypervigilance, scanning all surroundings and people as if they are about to hit me and I have to hit back.",1
1160,ptsd,"I could be stretching, but I feel like this ""fight"" response as opposed to my old ""flight"" or ""freeze"" response has effected even the emotional aspects of my attacks.",1
1161,ptsd,I am just too numb and burned out.,1
1162,ptsd,I can love people but I can't fall in love with them.,1
1163,ptsd,"I can't give them what they need, the regular sex or the emotional intimacy, and I just end up feeling guilty.",1
1164,ptsd,"I can get along with them just fine, I can respect them and consider their feelings, but that's not enough.",1
1165,ptsd,"This 100% stems from the abuse from my ex, and him training me to always be home.",1
1166,ptsd,"It home, go in my bed and lay there and watch some TV show or another while I'm on my phone.",1
1167,ptsd,"I eat dinner, then lay back in my bed until I decide to go to bed.",1
1168,ptsd,Am I making too big of a deal out of this?,1
1169,ptsd,"I thought about going to HR about it, but I'm in a position where I can't jeopardize this job, and I'm not the most well-liked person on the team (nothing that I did, I was hired externally for a position that 3 internals wanted), for whatever that's worth.",1
1170,ptsd,"Recovery feels familiar, so it's less scary, but I'm also so much more tired of it all.",1
1171,ptsd,I want to move on.,1
1172,ptsd,After years of struggling I'm finally at a place where I feel comfortable in my own skin.,1
1173,ptsd,That's the day everything changed for me.,1
1174,ptsd,Some of my earliest memories are of the towers falling.,1
1175,ptsd,"I have a dog that I got during the abusive relationship that led to my PTSD,  though I could never prove it there were obvious signs that she was abused by my ex as well.",1
1176,ptsd,She has always been very sensitive to how people are feeling and acting (when I have an episode with my celiac disease she will curl up by my stomach and won't leave my side) could this be  a starting point for me to train her to recognise when I have a major panic attack and just lay with me until it passes?,1
1177,ptsd,He was not allowed to speak or talk to my parents.,1
1178,ptsd,My heart races and palpitates.,1
1179,ptsd,"When this intense part fades I just get stuck in my head for the rest of the day, exhausted.",1
1180,ptsd,How do you cope when ain't nobody got time for that?,1
1181,ptsd,"My grandmother was a bitch to my mother, my mother was a bitch to me, I had to act out in a way or another.",1

1183,ptsd,"“I’m writing this, because I am experiencing and attempting to avoid a full blown panic attack.",1
1184,ptsd,"I am stronger then my negative thoughts, and I do have the power to control them.",1
1185,ptsd,"Writing about it makes it seem less real, and it isn’t.",1
1186,ptsd,My dream keeps playing in my head like a record and each time i get a glimpse of the record I avoid it.,1
1187,ptsd,I was abusive and my mother was scared for her life.,1
1188,ptsd,The first time I remember her telling everyone she was scared I would kill her I was about 7.,1
1189,ptsd,I had only raised my voice in protest because I was being severely punished for 7 days for “lying”.,1
1190,ptsd,Me and my sisters relationship has been strained most of my life but recently she had been opening up to me about the neglect and some fat shaming she experienced as a child.,1
1191,ptsd,It's pretty embarrassing in social and professional settings to the point people think I'm faking but I really can't control my reaction.,1
1192,ptsd,I was diagnosed Bipolar and BPD however this symptom in particular doesn't really match up with either of those.,1
1193,ptsd,"As far as I know I'm not officially diagnosed PTSD, doctors I've seen have confirmed symptoms seeing as I had a very traumatic childhood.",1
1194,ptsd,"Gosh, I know.",1
1195,ptsd,"And we can feel guilty about things we have done, we can feel guilty about things we didn't do, but wish we had, and of course we can feel guilty for nothing at all.",1
1196,ptsd,We don't have to have done something or omitted to do something in order to feel guilty.,1
1197,ptsd,Others can make us feel guilty through their expectations of us.,1
1198,ptsd,"Expectations can lead to disappointment, and their feeling of disappointment can lead to our feeling of guilt.",1
1199,ptsd,I realize that why I’m “ok” is because I am now  past the acute phase of ptsd that I developed last year.,1

2086,survivorsofabuse,When he got drunk he would literally switch back and forth to being happy and giggly to wanting to die and hating himself.,1
2087,survivorsofabuse,This is an idea that my father also reinforced in me heavily.,1
2088,survivorsofabuse,"I remember vividly when I told him that everything was my fault (in my child mind obviously meaning ""you make everything my fault"" which was very much the state of things in the house growing up) and he straight up told me to stop fucking up so much if I didn't want things to be my fault (I should emphasize all ""fuck ups"" were minor- letting a pack of strawberries go to waste, forgetting to call him as soon as I left school, etc- but punished severely).",1
2089,survivorsofabuse,"Hell, even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim.",1

2105,survivorsofabuse,I was completely uncomfortable the entire time.,1
2106,survivorsofabuse,"I have therapy, I'm on medication.",1

2108,survivorsofabuse,I want to crawl into a hole and just cry and scream.,1
2109,survivorsofabuse,It sucks even more because I won't be able to see my therapist this week because of the 4th of July holiday.,1
2110,survivorsofabuse,I'm so shaken up over this.,1
2111,survivorsofabuse,Even though we did break up I don't know if he's taking it seriously and if he just thinks I'll come home and we'll be ok.,1
2112,survivorsofabuse,I'm so tired of being treated like shit by everyone in my life.,1
2113,survivorsofabuse,"I'm not strong enough to take care of myself, to fight back, to leave.",1
2114,survivorsofabuse,"And I can't work, I can't even answer phone calls because of my anxiety, how am I supposed to survive?",1
2115,survivorsofabuse,"My family doesn't understand my mental issues so I can't get help from them with it, they tell me I need to start looking for a job and I can't even say anything.",1
2116,survivorsofabuse,Why did I have to scream in pain?,1
2117,survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes the bashings would be so bad that I would call my mum while she was at work [sometimes my brother and I would be home alone after I returned from school, when he would torment and bash me].",1
2118,survivorsofabuse,I would run into my room and lean against the bedroom door with all my weight while my brother kicked and punched through it from the other side.,1
2119,survivorsofabuse,"Once, the wood splintered and went into my back.",1
2120,survivorsofabuse,Still no-one stopped him.,1
2121,survivorsofabuse,"Me and my Dad aren't on speaking terms, however we do live in the same house.",1
2122,survivorsofabuse,Mainly because I'm not financially able to leave and live on my own.,1
2123,survivorsofabuse,"I do plan on leaving, but until I make enough money to do so I'm stuck here.",1
2124,survivorsofabuse,"I want to share what has led to this point, because to be honest I feel like I'm pathetic, weak in incapable of accomplishing anything.",1
2125,survivorsofabuse,Everything I do to move forwards seems to be halted and I feel like I'm being pushed back.,1
2126,survivorsofabuse,"So, long story short my parents are terribly abusive, I'm almost 30 and it took me this long, with the help of my wife to realize this.",1
2127,survivorsofabuse,"Lots of things happened, too many to list in a single post, but it got much worse last year when my daughter was molested by my younger brother.",1
2128,survivorsofabuse,"We had asked my parents to watch my two daughters due to a medical emergency, and that's when it happened, with my father in the room, his eyes glued to his cell phone.",1
2129,survivorsofabuse,"We involved CPS, the police, but my daughter didn't quite tell the police everything, and with their investigation, they could not press charges against him.",1
2130,survivorsofabuse,"After their investigation was complete, we informed my parents of what happened, and they called my then 5 year old daughter a liar to her face.",1
2131,survivorsofabuse,Before it happened I had been good friends with him and I admired him a lot as a child.,1
2132,survivorsofabuse,"I don't want to ruin his life, and whenever I meet him I act normal and happy.",1
2133,survivorsofabuse,When I talk about him I smile and act normal.,1
2134,survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes I feel like I can forgive him for what happened, but sometimes I have nightmares and I feel dirty.",1
2135,survivorsofabuse,I think of what happened a lot.,1
2136,survivorsofabuse,"I've been seeing the same one since then, and she'd helped me process so much, help me recognize and start to move past a lot of things...",1
2137,survivorsofabuse,"I went from hating and fearing my father (since the incident with my sister, which had ended up triggering the memory of being told that I was to blame for the marital issues, among other things) to the point I couldn't even be around him at family or friend gatherings without feeling anxious and wanting to flee, to being able to accept the things that happened in the past, and remind myself that they are in the past, and be able to interact with him again, even if I don't really feel any familial love for him anymore.",1
2138,survivorsofabuse,"I care about him, his wellbeing, but...  That familial bond isn't there, he killed it the he came to retrieve his stuff, a couple days after walking out...",1
2139,survivorsofabuse,The only time I ever stood up to him.,1
2140,survivorsofabuse,"He made some snide remark about my mother, and I told him to go ahead and run from his problems like he always does, and he backed me into a corner and shook me, screamed over me when I collapsed, until my mother came home and made him leave.",1
2141,survivorsofabuse,It seemed like there was no recognition of my emotional state and like he just wanted me to be quiet.,1
2142,survivorsofabuse,That scares me.,1
2143,survivorsofabuse,"He claims he was trying to help comfort me, but I really am having trouble believing that.",1
2144,survivorsofabuse,This is the second time something like this has happened.,1
2145,survivorsofabuse,The first time was when we were arguing and it was getting really heated.,1
2146,survivorsofabuse,"But it hit close to home when my own parents have pressured me over the years to reconcile with my brother, angrily demanding how I'd handle their funerals, whether I'd insist on not going (I wouldn't.",1
2147,survivorsofabuse,"My brother was best man for our other brother's wedding, which I attended but declined being a bridesmaid, and kept a careful distance.",1
2148,survivorsofabuse,"Then I went home, drank an entire bottle of wine and cried while my husband comforted me).",1
2149,survivorsofabuse,2.,1
2150,survivorsofabuse,I never would have known about my cousin's son if I hadn't been able to make the funeral yesterday.,1
2151,survivorsofabuse,He was furious I'd 'kept' that from him.,1
2152,survivorsofabuse,I had considered doing cam modelling though had never gone through with it (again before we even met) .,1
2153,survivorsofabuse,He accused me of lying and keeping things from him.,1
2154,survivorsofabuse,"On top of that, he still expected sex all the time.",1
2155,survivorsofabuse,"I still liked it, but I was so stressed from the move and from the constant crying and fighting that my libido was down.",1
2156,survivorsofabuse,It sucks because I work on a computer and type all day at work and do needlepoint and sewing as a hobby and I can't do those things when it's this bad.,1
2157,survivorsofabuse,"Of course when people (family, coworkers, friends) see the brace they ask what happened.",1
2158,survivorsofabuse,I always blame carpal tunnel.,1
2159,survivorsofabuse,I feel so angry that I am still covering up for my abuser.,1
2160,survivorsofabuse,I am angry I can't e joy my life without him showing up randomly.,1
2161,survivorsofabuse,When I went back the next day he said the good news was he wasn't going to lie to me anymore.,1
2162,survivorsofabuse,"He said ""if you can take a raping like that and still come back, there's nothing I could do to make you leave.""",1
2163,survivorsofabuse,"And ""There's no point in lying any more"" He always told me from then on when he was cheating, doing something wrong, etc.",1
2164,survivorsofabuse,I thought about turning him in.,1
2165,survivorsofabuse,I took some pictures on my phone to maybe show the police.,1
2166,survivorsofabuse,"It was the same therapist I'd been seeing since I was little, when I was first diagnosed as ASD (at the time termed PDD-NOS, as I didn't *quite* fit the diagnostic requirements for Aspergers), and she, had honestly stopped being helpful.",1
2167,survivorsofabuse,"Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse.",1
2168,survivorsofabuse,"Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started.",1
2169,survivorsofabuse,"So, I eventually stopped going.",1
2170,survivorsofabuse,"And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.",1
2171,survivorsofabuse,He knew about this.,1
2172,survivorsofabuse,He asks me if I want to stop.,1
2173,survivorsofabuse,"I'm violently sobbing, so yes, of course I want to stop.",1
2174,survivorsofabuse,He holds me for a couple of minutes.,1
2175,survivorsofabuse,"And then he starts talking about T again, even though we'd broken up the sexual arrangement months ago.",1
2176,survivorsofabuse,I have some tainted memories with my dad and have doubts about my grandpa.,1
2177,survivorsofabuse,Anyway I don't control when some of these memories and questions pop up.,1
2178,survivorsofabuse,"I feel really bad about myself when it happens, sometimes I cry and other times I just have rage.",1
2179,survivorsofabuse,I don't feel like I can talk about it with anyone.,1
2180,survivorsofabuse,"I could really use some advice on how to deal with these memories and emotions when they take over, or if any of you have found ways to stop memories from popping up?",1
2181,survivorsofabuse,"In the first month I was living here, I was doing a lot of really self-destructive things and ended up hospitalising myself, but now I have a job and am working very heavy hours to keep myself busy, and am not drinking heavily or using drugs or self-harming.",1
2182,survivorsofabuse,"Unfortunately, I'm also more or less repressing all my feelings, and I'm having trouble with mood swings (particularly anger), anxiety and more recently, daily migraines.",1
2183,survivorsofabuse,Any suggestions?,1
2184,survivorsofabuse,"Particularly suggestions for someone who works 40+ hours a week, so doesn't have much time to relax anyway?",1
2185,survivorsofabuse,"I hate living here, but don't have much choice for the foreseeable future.",1
2186,survivorsofabuse,"I didn't understand why he wanted to get me an erection, and I certainly didn't want him to do that to me, but he did.",1

2404,survivorsofabuse,Now at 30 years old I went to a therapist.,1
2405,survivorsofabuse,I found out that my behaviors are probably caused by suppressing my memories and not finding proper closure from the incident because it’s as if I’m still taking the blame for an abuse that was done to me.,1
2406,survivorsofabuse,He purposely said the most hurtful things to me during our break up to make himself feel better.,1
2407,survivorsofabuse,"And one of the worst things of all, like I mentioned earlier, he sexually assaulted and that also happened when he knew we were breaking up.",1
2408,survivorsofabuse,"Knowing how terrible of a person he is that some people have even told me he is a narcissist or sociopath, I don't know why I still think I should have just stayed, why I should have just seen if he could change despite how he never tried to change throughout our years together.",1
2409,survivorsofabuse,"I just want to stop myself from thinking this way and fully move on and have myself realize I am so much better off, and I even try to remind myself of all the bad things he has done but it seems that lingering thought of, ""Well, was it ever that bad?""",1
2410,survivorsofabuse,keeps returning.,1
2411,survivorsofabuse,"Three months of this and talking with the one friend whom I could call for free between 9pm and 6AM due to AT&T's GoPhone policies whenever I could get away with it, or texting on a Nokia Tracphone (the ancient indestructible brick phone), and my sister lashing out at me about being ungrateful that they allowed me to come over and use the internet, triggered by my snapping back due to, something, I can't remember, and I just, stopped asking.",1
2412,survivorsofabuse,"Ended up losing contact with everyone but the one friend I could talk to maybe, once or twice a week for a couple hours.",1
2413,survivorsofabuse,"She'd try to keep me apprised of stuff going on with folks, and those phonecalls ended up bring the spark that bloomed into us being a couple, but...",1
2414,survivorsofabuse,It wasn't enough.,1
2415,survivorsofabuse,"The same negativity, the same feelings of selfhatred, of self-disgust, of ***believing*** everything my father had dumped on me slowly took over.",1
2416,survivorsofabuse,"Some examples: spit on me randomly in the eye doctor's office, giggled and strolled off when I looked up at him in horror.",1
2417,survivorsofabuse,"We had some verbal exchange in the hallway and he slapped me so hard I couldn't feel the tear roll down my cheek my face was so numb, he pinned me to the floor one day and savagely beat me for at least 7 minutes straight for what reason i forget, after he was done beating me up he would punch in the back of the head repeatedly, this gave me headaches and i saw flashes with each blow.",1
2418,survivorsofabuse,And he would often have a gleeful look on his face after he was done.,1
2419,survivorsofabuse,"For the longest I didn't know this was abuse, nor did I know I had developed all of these poor coping mechanisms to deal with being abused.",1
2420,survivorsofabuse,He ruined my life without me even being aware.,1
2421,survivorsofabuse,I wonder about that night.,1
2422,survivorsofabuse,Did you ever get past that night?,1
2423,survivorsofabuse,Did you have other nights like that?,1
2424,survivorsofabuse,Did anyone ever ask if you were okay?,1
2425,survivorsofabuse,Do you forgive me?,1
2426,survivorsofabuse,Trauma changed the trajectory of my life.,1
2427,survivorsofabuse,But I don't know if I would feel this way about my options if I wasn't anxious and wounded.,1
2428,survivorsofabuse,"My ex and I broke up because he never liked to leave the house, even for daytime activities.",1
2429,survivorsofabuse,I wonder sometimes how I am going to feel when I hit middle age.,1
2430,survivorsofabuse,Am I going to feel like I do now?,1
2431,survivorsofabuse,"But how do I keep going with this girl and eventually ask her to hang out again because no romantic relationship can really progress forward until we're physically intimate with each other, but we can't get there unless we hang out.",1
2432,survivorsofabuse,And she doesn't even like talking on the phone and just texts.,1
2433,survivorsofabuse,I feel like I'm having a relationship with my phone sometimes and it's like a female Wilson sometimes lol (movie Castaway reference for those who don't know).,1
2434,survivorsofabuse,"Anyone who has been in an abusive relationship and came out of it or anyone who dated an abused survivor, how do you advise that I progress things with her?",1
2435,survivorsofabuse,\*\*TL;DR\*\* I'm dating a girl who was formerly in an abusive relationship.,1
2436,survivorsofabuse,"and ""how could you let me do this?""",1
2437,survivorsofabuse,"Although my family and friends will never see this, I'm here to answer the question: ""why?""",1
2438,survivorsofabuse,It wasn't as simple as some of my friends may think.,1
2439,survivorsofabuse,"I didn't magically wake up one day and think ""You know what, I think I'll let my abuser walk me down the aisle.""",1
2440,survivorsofabuse,It's taken 5 years for me just to sit across from him and have dinner without having a full blown panic attack.,1
2441,survivorsofabuse,Those are all the ones I can coherently explain.,1
2442,survivorsofabuse,I've also felt extremely lonely and I've been craving touch more than I did before I was with him.,1
2443,survivorsofabuse,"Watching movies, playing games, hanging out with friends etc all distract me for a while but when I stop all the bad feelings just come at once.",1
2444,survivorsofabuse,"Not only sadness/loneliness, but I also feel hate and rage.",1
2445,survivorsofabuse,Does anyone have any way to help me move on?,1
2446,survivorsofabuse,Now: The brother who texted me just had a baby girl with his wife.,1
2447,survivorsofabuse,He now has a total of three baby girls at home (age range 3-0).,1
2448,survivorsofabuse,"Gut reaction: fear, dread, anxiety.",1
2449,survivorsofabuse,I don’t want to meet her.,1
2450,survivorsofabuse,I'm in college now and got high last night and felt pretty sad.,1
2451,survivorsofabuse,I'm a wreck.,1
2452,survivorsofabuse,I thought I've overcome this all but I'm just feeling alone again.,1
2453,survivorsofabuse,After trauma i started isolating myself and attaching to creative work to get a sense of worth.,1
2454,survivorsofabuse,I declined socially by a lot and can't feel connected to anyone past a surface level.,1
2455,survivorsofabuse,"Hi everyone, this is my story, what I've been able to take away from it, and the feelings and the hurt that have lingered, as well as questions.",1
2456,survivorsofabuse,"Warning, this is kind of a long post, but there is a lot I need to say and just get out of my head.",1
2457,survivorsofabuse,"Trigger and Content Warnings**:** Explicit mentions of sex acts with some details,mentions of coercion, mentions of being threatened, mentions of alcoholism.",1
2458,survivorsofabuse,"Things to know about me, for the context of my life and who I am: I am 24, I am queer, my pronouns are she/her, I am trans-gender woman (please Google if you are unfamiliar with the terms), I am autistic, and as a child I was home-schooled for a very long time and lived in the middle of nowhere farm country, with no buses, sidewalks, or means of transportation.",1
2459,survivorsofabuse,"When I was 13, I had just found out my father was diagnosed with early onset dementia and I was stricken, to say the least, knowing that my already dysfunctional family was about to go through the horrors of watching my father become less and less of himself.",1
2460,survivorsofabuse,"Hello, I'm 22, female and from the UK.",1
2461,survivorsofabuse,I'm kind of freaking out right now because I think something happened to me as a child.,1
2462,survivorsofabuse,"I don't even know, I'm sorry I wish I had something concrete to say but I don't think I could even type it out.",1
2463,survivorsofabuse,The problem is I've recently moved to Japan on my own and have no one to talk to here.,1
2464,survivorsofabuse,I would normally talk to my boyfriend but he's not awake and I don't even know what I'd say to him - I don't even feel like I can say anything out loud even if I was with him.,1
2465,survivorsofabuse,So I let myself get sucked in and...,1
2466,survivorsofabuse,The incident that occured was that I threw a fit - my arms and legs thrashing in all directions.,1
2467,survivorsofabuse,"I had no idea what was happening, I came out of it terrified and there was one guy left in the room.",1
2468,survivorsofabuse,This guy told me I was possessed by an evil spirit.,1
2469,survivorsofabuse,"I remember thinking, he felt ""off"".",1
2470,survivorsofabuse,"Since then I have heard from him once, in the form of a drunken voicemail pleading with me to forgive him and swearing that he doesn't remember anything.",1
2471,survivorsofabuse,I may be able to believe that if I didn't know he was a manipulative pathological liar.,1
2472,survivorsofabuse,"The worst thing about this to me is that he has two kids, a little girl and a little boy who I absolutely adore.",1
2473,survivorsofabuse,I haven't been able to see them in five years (I'm nineteen now).,1
2474,survivorsofabuse,"If anyone is reading this, and you're wondering why I didn't call the police, I did.",1
2475,survivorsofabuse,I only realized this was a stupid idea in my freshman year of college when I started having flashbacks.,1
2476,survivorsofabuse,I tried once more to do therapy and almost failed out of school.,1
2477,survivorsofabuse,Again I buried it all to be dealt with at a more convenient time.,1
2478,survivorsofabuse,I have now been working in a job that don't mind for the last year and 3 months.,1
2479,survivorsofabuse,I found that November and December were a struggle and because of that I planned to address my stuff by going to therapy starting in 2019.,1
2480,survivorsofabuse,It is not like her - even when she was that age - to succumb to pressure like that.,1
2481,survivorsofabuse,"I'm trying really hard not to victim blame and immediately feel guilt when I think that way but, again, knowing my wife how I know her - as someone that's not afraid to call BS- it just makes it hard to conceive how she went along with it for so long, knowing that it made her uncomfortable, knowing that it was escalating, and then it was actual happening and her not saying no.",1
2482,survivorsofabuse,I just can't believe these things happened on repeated occasions.,1
2483,survivorsofabuse,"I can absolutely see him pressuring her once, her not knowing how to respond when it happened, and then her saying ""This is BS, I'm out"" afterwards.",1
2484,survivorsofabuse,But that she stuck around and let it happen multiple times just seems odd to me.,1
2485,survivorsofabuse,"It wasn't an issue, nobody needed to know, now I don't even know *what* people apparently ""know"" and are arguing about.",1
2486,survivorsofabuse,Somewhere under all the anger about my mum making an issue out of nothing there's something that makes me wonder if it *is* a big deal.,1
2487,survivorsofabuse,Maybe I'm just pretending I don't care?,1
2488,survivorsofabuse,Maybe none of this even happened?,1
2489,survivorsofabuse,I just don't know anymore.,1
2490,survivorsofabuse,My boyfriend didn't care.,1
2491,survivorsofabuse,I started to get psychotic at 17.,1
2492,survivorsofabuse,"I  was so scared, paranoid, had delusions and hallucinations.",1
2493,survivorsofabuse,And no-one to help me.,1
2494,survivorsofabuse,All this hell lasted until I was 22.,1
2495,survivorsofabuse,"I just couldn't cope, the abuse I already remembered was bad enough but this...this was just too much for me to deal with.",1
2496,survivorsofabuse,"2 weeks ago I couldn't take it anymore and took a large overdose, which ended up with me being in hospital...I now have done a little damage to my heart and shall have to live with that...I should probably point out that I am under 7st and have had an eating disorder since I was 7...it was the only thing I could control...you see I had no safe place, I'd leave my abusive home and go to school...where I was the only ginger child...sure I don't need to point out how hard that was.",1
2497,survivorsofabuse,"This is going to stop quite abruptly now, for I don't really know what else to say right now.. Each and everyday is a constant struggle and I am tired of drs telling me to be strong and just get on with life...I am 26years old for 20years I have had to be strong and ""survive"" well I'm tired of surviving...that doesn't mean I want to die but I do want it all to stop, I want to <url> to be happy and trust people, to realise what love is, I mean I have an amazing partner who loves me dearly but I question him every damn day...you see he doesn't hurt me and love...well as my Dad taught me...love is to hurt and lie....but that isn't love at all is it?",1
2498,survivorsofabuse,!,1
2499,survivorsofabuse,"I can recall one situation where I was accused of taking her credit card (I was 6 years old and before we had computers), the one she left in store, so decided to ransack my bedroom, destroying most of the gifts I got the Christmas.",1
2500,survivorsofabuse,"This resulted in being given a crumpled, unapologetic five-pound note.",1
2501,survivorsofabuse,"No sorry, nothing said, just the silence and dark stair.",1
2502,survivorsofabuse,"From a young age I was subjected to social seclusion, I was not allowed to hang out with any of the local kids in my town.",1
2503,survivorsofabuse,"Apparently, they were all ‘bad’ children and believed I would be influenced by them resulting in becoming, well I am not to sure what she expected.",1
2504,survivorsofabuse,It was all so wrong of me.,1
2505,survivorsofabuse,It started happening when we went to my father's bday weekend and a family member groped me and I remembered that he also did stuff like that.,1
2506,survivorsofabuse,A lot of em did.,1
2507,survivorsofabuse,My partner was sad and fell asleep after I told them.,1
2508,survivorsofabuse,I couldn't sleep.,1
2509,survivorsofabuse,I’ve been trying not to get triggered or stamping on the instincts to just leave the place and be silent.,1
2510,survivorsofabuse,"Even with that, I couldn’t even really keep a hold and have had hard days where I just wanted to stay isolated from the world and disappear in my mind and try to heal myself and it isn’t working.",1
2511,survivorsofabuse,"I struggle to sleep sometimes and I do struggle with self worth, being comfortable with myself because I just don’t see myself as someone who’s important to other ppl.",1
2512,survivorsofabuse,I'm really unsure how to deal with it.,1
2513,survivorsofabuse,"Also, I'm not sure if I should tell anyone because that couldn't have happened right and it could not have been that bad?",1
2514,survivorsofabuse,I feel like these experiences have totally altered my psyche and now i find gratification through exploitation.,1
2515,survivorsofabuse,I even had the painful realization that ive never had any normal sexual relationship and these abuses are all i know.,1
2516,survivorsofabuse,"I broke down the other night just crying realizing that i dont get to be normal, and that i have sick urges.",1
2517,survivorsofabuse,"I heard that theres high rates of abused people become abusers too, and i hate that im part of the issue.",1
2518,survivorsofabuse,"Tl;Dr: I was abused and now i abuse, what can i do to cope?",1
2519,survivorsofabuse,I'd wake up in the middle of the night to him feeling my ass and masturbating.,1
2520,survivorsofabuse,"I was scared, and didn't know what to do so I just pretended not to notice.",1
2521,survivorsofabuse,"I can't even remember how long this must have went on, but soon enough I had decided to put my pillow on the other side of the mattress, because he'd touch me when I sleep on my side.",1
2522,survivorsofabuse,"I thought putting my pillow on the other side of the bed will help because as I fall asleep and turn on my left side my back will be towards the wall, and he won't be able to reach.",1
2523,survivorsofabuse,I even remember him asking me the next day why I'd decided to move my pillow to the other side of the mattress.,1
2524,survivorsofabuse,"I was having a fucking panic attack.Once we payed and where done, we went into the thrift store to tell my mom we where done.",1
2525,survivorsofabuse,I finally told i was having a panic attack because he threatened to smack the crap out of me.,1
2526,survivorsofabuse,"""he threatened you?""",1
2527,survivorsofabuse,i could tell by my tone she doesn't believe me.,1
2528,survivorsofabuse,"""we're probably not coming here anymore"" she said.",1
2529,survivorsofabuse,So he leaned in and kissed me with tongue.,1
2530,survivorsofabuse,I was embarrassed because that was my first kiss.,1
2531,survivorsofabuse,Then the next time I saw him he stuck his fingers in me even though I said no and unzipped his pants.,1
2532,survivorsofabuse,I kicked him off of me and rode my bike all the way home with blood running down my legs.,1
2533,survivorsofabuse,I didn't tell my dad because I was afraid he would beat me.,1
2534,survivorsofabuse,"Part of me wonders if it's not my mom's fine-tuned manipulation at work, but it's sure as hell eating at me.",1
2535,survivorsofabuse,How do I get out of his harmful headspace?,1
2536,survivorsofabuse,It feels like my emotions and my logic are at war right now.,1
2537,survivorsofabuse,Even after the abuse and trauma I've endured at the hands of my mom I still question the validity of my experience because I know there are people that have it a lot worse.,1
2538,survivorsofabuse,"And seeing that video was like watching a train wreck, it made me feel so awful because of its violent nature but it also made me doubt a lot of what I'm still experiencing.",1
2539,survivorsofabuse,I was terrified and scared and couldn't get away.,1
2540,survivorsofabuse,"She just said he was ""joking around"" but it was horrible.",1
2541,survivorsofabuse,I get a sting of panic and fear if anyone pinches me today.,1
2542,survivorsofabuse,"I can't even use a lighter without fear of it (Fire is fine, it's Just that kind of lighters).",1
2543,survivorsofabuse,I also panic if anybody raises their voice or sounds angry.,1
2544,survivorsofabuse,I was going through a hard time after our breakup (started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist).,1
2545,survivorsofabuse,In the span of the 2.5 years since our breakup I have had other boyfriends and hookups.,1
2546,survivorsofabuse,"Some of my hookups happened to be some of his old friends, the most recent happening 11 months ago.",1
2547,survivorsofabuse,"I never talked to these guys leading up to the hook ups or since, it was purely just spur of the moment drunk sex.",1
2548,survivorsofabuse,Recently me and my ex have reconnected after 2.5 years of no contact.,1
2549,survivorsofabuse,"According to [a study from <url> and its subjects, major risk factors were family problems and a child’s lack of confidence.",1
2550,survivorsofabuse,These factors aren’t necessarily easy to influence but well worth looking into.,1
2551,survivorsofabuse,As is another avenue that we should focus on more: Support for survivors of sexual abuse.,1
2552,survivorsofabuse,"Availability and quality of mental health care comes to mind, but it’s not solely limited to the medical field.",1
2553,survivorsofabuse,"If we want abusers to be held accountable, we have to help victims because they might not come forward otherwise.",1
2554,survivorsofabuse,"This was a “nice thought”, and even though I had been told my mother to never leave a drink at the bar, it didn’t cross my mind that there might be something put in this drink or that I was being pushed to be more intoxicated.",1
2555,survivorsofabuse,"After I started sipping on that drink, I felt all the alcohol hit me and felt drunk.",1
2556,survivorsofabuse,"He said I’ve ordered an uber for us, which I thought I was being dropped back at home; I don’t actually remember the ride home in the Uber.",1
2557,survivorsofabuse,"We pulled up at his apartment complex, and he said come inside I know you’re hungry I have pizza.",1
2558,survivorsofabuse,"I thought eating pizza would be a good idea after the alcohol, so I followed him inside.",1
2559,survivorsofabuse,"These weren't the only punishments, though.",1
2560,survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes he'd make us choose a favorite toy or plushie to be thrown out if we'd made him mad, and one time when he caught me rescuing my plushie, he slapped me across the face, then made me watch him cut her into little pieces, standing there at 1 in the morning berating me about how I was a stupid, ignorant little bitch that needed right and wrong beaten into her, because I was too stupid to to know how to do as I was told.",1
2561,survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes, though, he'd not just snap and get angry...",1
2562,survivorsofabuse,He'd utterly lose control of himself.,1
2563,survivorsofabuse,"Screaming so furiously I couldn't really understand him, grabbing me by the arms/shoulders and shaking me hard enough to give me whiplash, and continue screaming over me once I collapsed in a cowering heap when he let go.",1
2564,survivorsofabuse,7.,1
2565,survivorsofabuse,This study will include only participants who are 18 years and older.,1
2566,survivorsofabuse,Please send us a private message if you are interested in participating.,1
2567,survivorsofabuse,"Once you contact us, we will send you a link to the screening questionnaire to see if you qualify and to tell you more about the study.",1
2568,survivorsofabuse,"Please note: If you participated in this study at any point in 2016 through Vanderbilt University, unfortunately you are not eligible to participate again.",1
2569,survivorsofabuse,There was no need for child care.,1
2570,survivorsofabuse,"When our daughter was 3, my husband, her father, taught her the word privacy.",1
2571,survivorsofabuse,He then explained to her 3 yr old self what it means so she could understand.,1
2572,survivorsofabuse,"It was so cute when I would try and help her with her bath, and she would say ""no mommy, I need my PRIVATY..LOL.",1
2573,survivorsofabuse,we encouraged this as she got older.,1
2574,survivorsofabuse,Do not drink a lot and only eat mild food before and during event.,1
2575,survivorsofabuse,Gave myself permission to leave for any reason whenever I wanted.,1
2576,survivorsofabuse,Giving myself control has allowed me to return to meetings at work in peace.,1
2577,survivorsofabuse,I have been doing this for about 24 years.,1
2578,survivorsofabuse,No one knows I have these fears.,1
2579,survivorsofabuse,"As the years went by the town labelled them as high school sweethearts, and every teenager envied their relationship.",1
2580,survivorsofabuse,"Everywhere she went, he followed.",1
2581,survivorsofabuse,"Every sport he played, she cheered.",1
2582,survivorsofabuse,"Through rain, sleet, snow, and sunshine she was in the stands proudly cheering him on.",1
2583,survivorsofabuse,In their own little world they were in love.,1
2584,survivorsofabuse,The worst he's ever done is yell.,1
2585,survivorsofabuse,He does not seek out confrontation and he certainly doesn't threaten people.,1
2586,survivorsofabuse,That's not to say he couldn't hold his own in a fight.,1
2587,survivorsofabuse,My uncle apparently got the message and started crying and begged for forgiveness.,1
2588,survivorsofabuse,"My dad told him that he believes he could eventually forgive him, but that doesn't mean he would have anything to do with him.",1
2589,survivorsofabuse,"thought, if its not going to listen to me talk, I'll send an easy to read article (they literally listed the differences in bullet points) and a video.",1
2590,survivorsofabuse,Still ignored it.,1
2591,survivorsofabuse,"I've also adopted the Eleven's ""no second chances"" policy from Doctor Who.",1
2592,survivorsofabuse,"Later in the night, I sent a text that basically said told it to be more supportive and actively listen (communication, bitch), or I can't continue to be around it.",1
2593,survivorsofabuse,"I went to sleep and woke up to it saying, ""fine, I guess we'll see other people, then!""",1
2594,survivorsofabuse,I tend not to like driving long distances in cars with people in unfamiliar places still but I feel good just that I am back on the road even if I don't drive the car.,1
2595,survivorsofabuse,This took me about five years to reach this level of comfort.,1
2596,survivorsofabuse,All of my fears:  I started to exercise hard every single day.,1
2597,survivorsofabuse,Heavy exercise would defeat the fear in most cases or make it easy to manage.,1
2598,survivorsofabuse,"If I did not exercise, I was a walking fear bomb.",1
2599,survivorsofabuse,"I really liked this guy, he was super funny and easy to talk to, and he seemed really trustworthy to me.",1
2600,survivorsofabuse,He told me he had been keeping an eye on me since he saw Pedo talking to me a lot and hanging around me a lot.,1
2601,survivorsofabuse,"He told me that two other girls around my age had worked with him before me, but not at the same time.",1
2602,survivorsofabuse,"Both girls had quit a couple of months into their jobs, even though they were doing well, seemed happy and very much liked their positions.",1
2603,survivorsofabuse,"He told me that both girls had complained a few times to him that Pedo had grown very attached to them and made them feel very uncomfortable, but didn’t know what to do because he was their boss.",1
2604,survivorsofabuse,"He's exactly what I've needed, maintains his side of an equal partnership, etc.",1
2605,survivorsofabuse,"My only problem is that, though our sex life is great, I catch myself being overly sexual sometimes, even if he shows no interest that occasional day, then feeling extremely hurt and rejected if he says that he doesn't want to do anything that day.",1
2606,survivorsofabuse,"It's not like we never do anything, I just seem to still be attached to this idea.",1
2607,survivorsofabuse,He shows me he loves me in many different ways but this is so hurtful when I'm aware that it's ridiculous to have these expectations.,1
2608,survivorsofabuse,I guess I'm afraid I'll never stop feeling this way and I'll end up hurt him.,1
2609,survivorsofabuse,"So I am okay at making short-term acquaintances, but can't seem to make friends beyond professional relationships, polite greetings, small-talk, etc.",1
2610,survivorsofabuse,I'm sure it's because I have no practice at making friends and the history of relationships I have had feel laced with feelings of betrayal - so maybe I'm self-sabotaging a little bit.,1
2611,survivorsofabuse,"But gosh, I would like someone to talk to about day to day life, hopes, worries, goals, etc.",1
2612,survivorsofabuse,"Also, I have an eleven year old son for whom I would like to model some more healthy platonic relationships.",1
2613,survivorsofabuse,"I work in a field that requires little one-on-one contact, rely on walking/public transportation, and have a busy schedule with kids activities, work, community meetings, so those factors make it extra hard.",1
2614,survivorsofabuse,I have the inner-peace I was seeking for decades!,1
2615,survivorsofabuse,I finally feel like I'm a decent person.,1
2616,survivorsofabuse,"I go out of my way to make others feel comfortable, and welcomed, and loved.",1

2637,survivorsofabuse,"Designer clothes, designer makeup, way too much freedom, gym membership, and anything else a 14 year old girl could ever want.",1
2638,survivorsofabuse,I think a lot of that comes from the fact that we were not able to provide her with anything for so long.,1
2639,survivorsofabuse,She wrapped her arms around me and cried for dear life I growled at him to stop at once for he had scared her..he tried to take her from me as he continued to yell and she would not let him touch her That was the final straw.,1

2641,survivorsofabuse,"He turned into the fake man I fell in love with again, but I was done",1
2642,survivorsofabuse,When we were leaving that place the manager was attempting to rush us to get our apartment serviced with 24 hour notices of intimidation and behaving in an angry way leaving mean voicemails and papers at our pissed on door.,1

2700,survivorsofabuse,Was this abuse?,1
2701,survivorsofabuse,Were I abused as a child?,1
2702,survivorsofabuse,He accidentally held my throat too tight and the marks of his affections remained on my long after he was a memory.,1
2703,survivorsofabuse,He pulled out my tears and scared my face pale so not one person could see the marks of blood left on my neck.,1
2704,survivorsofabuse,Then my world was dipped in white tint so no one could observe the taint behind my devastation.,1
2705,survivorsofabuse,The color of my skin and the color of the fear were almost a perfect match although my fear was clearly a shade lighter than what was underneath.,1

2712,survivorsofabuse,We were roughly the same age.,1

2714,survivorsofabuse,"However, Zach wasn't that smart, he was average, yet very decent and very cool.",1
2715,survivorsofabuse,"Fast forward to our first quarter test, after finishing all my exams during the day, James asked me, out of the blue, ""Saan mo mas gusto?",1
2716,survivorsofabuse,"He did threaten to walk out when I tried to crack a third, and I stopped.",1
2717,survivorsofabuse,"He says this is so rewarding for him, but is really open about how tough it has been as well.",1
2718,survivorsofabuse,"The therapist, though she is more closed mouthed and less personally emotional, has said she has required supervision several times over me.",1
2719,survivorsofabuse,"No matter how nice they are, if I fuck up months of progress, decisions about where this is going seem likely.",1
2720,survivorsofabuse,Getting this out seems to have helped a fair bit.,1
2721,survivorsofabuse,At 26... it was a roller coaster ride.,1
2722,survivorsofabuse,It was great at the start... then I caught him with someone else at a party.,1
2723,survivorsofabuse,"I broke up there and then, realised I couldn't let go... we got back together, we broke up, he became abusive... it went downhill from there.",1
2724,survivorsofabuse,I just couldn't let go of him.,1
2725,survivorsofabuse,I kept hoping it would work out... it never did.,1
2726,survivorsofabuse,Nothing was bothering them.,1
2727,survivorsofabuse,Nobody was being a bully at school.,1
2728,survivorsofabuse,Their grades started to slip.,1
2729,survivorsofabuse,I was asking the right questions but they kept saying nothing was going on.,1
2730,survivorsofabuse,Fast forward six months.,1
2731,survivorsofabuse,You try harder to focus on the screen when another turns on.,1
2732,survivorsofabuse,The screen is large enough that you can clearly make out that it is most definitely a memory.,1
2733,survivorsofabuse,"The more you focus, the more screens turn on all showing the same memory.",1
2734,survivorsofabuse,"The last screen is so clear, the picture so perfect that it's almost like you are there.",1
2735,survivorsofabuse,"As you watch, you realize that you aren't watching anymore- you are in the memory again.",1
2736,survivorsofabuse,It didn’t seem innocent.,1
2737,survivorsofabuse,It looked like he’d seen something like that before and wanted someone to try it on.,1
2738,survivorsofabuse,"My parents were more strict and didn’t let me watch much things with violence, etc., and his were more lax, so maybe that was a factor.",1
2739,survivorsofabuse,"Also, he was the golden child in my extended family: charming, comedic, artistic.",1
2740,survivorsofabuse,He got a pass a LOT.,1
2741,survivorsofabuse,"When I was one, my parents got divorced.",1
2742,survivorsofabuse,My parents HATE each other so I have never had a good relationship with either of them.,1
2743,survivorsofabuse,When I was 4  my mom remarried to a horrible man (that she is still married to) but I didn't realize how horrible he was until recently.,1
2744,survivorsofabuse,Until I was 8 (when we moved for his job and he wasn't home as much) he whipped me with a belt whenever I did ANYTHING he didn't like.,1
2745,survivorsofabuse,He would make me pull down my pants and he would whip me until I was hysterically crying in pain.,1
2746,survivorsofabuse,"We are 21 now, both turning 22 next month.",1
2747,survivorsofabuse,"It started off as friendly catching up, but things have gotten more romantic and we have been hanging out a lot more.",1
2748,survivorsofabuse,"I wasn’t sure we could ever be together again, but I no longer have feelings of sadness or resentment regarding what he did to me.",1
2749,survivorsofabuse,"I have noticed by the way he carries himself now, he has definitely matured.",1
2750,survivorsofabuse,I guess I just want to know when or if I should tell him I hooked up with his friends?,1
2751,survivorsofabuse,I turned 15 shortly after meeting him.,1
2752,survivorsofabuse,He started out so kind and loving.,1
2753,survivorsofabuse,And then it just... turned.,1
2754,survivorsofabuse,"It turned from compliments into me not being able to wear certain things, say certain things, do certain things.",1
2755,survivorsofabuse,"I was barely allowed to be online, no longer able to post anything relating to the music I used to create before him.",1
2756,survivorsofabuse,We were raised in the Bible belt and she believed every word they told her about it being normal.,1
2757,survivorsofabuse,I tried so hard to explain it to her over the years.,1
2758,survivorsofabuse,She never understood.,1
2759,survivorsofabuse,Even now she barely talks to me because I'm the 'outcast' for standing against what my family has done.,1
2760,survivorsofabuse,We were so close when were younger because it's all we had.,1
2761,survivorsofabuse,"They've done a lot that's cut down my self-esteem and such, but they've also done a lot for me too.",1
2762,survivorsofabuse,"I have a home, I'm well-fed, I have my own possessions, I have a car, and I have some wonderful memories with them.",1
2763,survivorsofabuse,"When I was molested, they came to my rescue and constantly stood up for me when nobody else believed me.",1
2764,survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes they're the most amazing parents I can ask for, and other times I'm afraid of them.",1
2765,survivorsofabuse,"My mother isn't that bad, but my father is the worst.",1
2766,survivorsofabuse,"When I dare to open up to my friends, they tell me ‘Oh, my brother used to fight with me too’ and I feel diminished and dismissed.",1
2767,survivorsofabuse,Since I left home at 21 and moved to the other side of the country I tried to talk up my family.,1
2768,survivorsofabuse,"I started from a place of recognising their vulnerability, justifying their actions by saying they were distracted by our financial woes and my dads early onset dementia.",1
2769,survivorsofabuse,I told everyone they were amazing people.,1
2770,survivorsofabuse,For the past two decades I have fought my body.,1
2771,survivorsofabuse,"But those are your most valuable skills, they are your surviving skills.",1
2772,survivorsofabuse,"And yeah, not everyone has them.",1
2773,survivorsofabuse,Here is how you can translate your survivor skills into your further success.,1
2774,survivorsofabuse,&#x200B; Time management and Organization,1
2775,survivorsofabuse,I am 26 but I have many years ahead of me still to go.,1
2776,survivorsofabuse,"As always, any questions please ask away, share your experiences or even just give some information on how you cope.",1
2777,survivorsofabuse,"I hope you enjoyed reading this (as morbid as it sounds) but this was the hardest to write, a step forward to finally making it public.",1
2778,survivorsofabuse,I have quite a few things going on for the next couple of weeks so will be taking a break from writing.,1
2779,survivorsofabuse,Expect the next part around the 15th.,1
2780,survivorsofabuse,"We have dinner, we get drinks, and I agree to try again.",1
2781,survivorsofabuse,"I want to say here, I have never had this kind of behavior before.",1
2782,survivorsofabuse,"When I’ve broken up with someone, or had them break up with me, even if I’m heartbroken I’ve always been done.",1
2783,survivorsofabuse,So I don’t know what the disconnect is here.,1
2784,survivorsofabuse,It’s been a little over two weeks now we’ve been seeing each other again.,1
2785,survivorsofabuse,Eventually he did it less.,1
2786,survivorsofabuse,"He would also make direct eye contact with me when he was seducing my mother, which filled me with so much rage.",1
2787,survivorsofabuse,This happened throughout my adolescence.,1
2788,survivorsofabuse,He acted hurt or offended because I always had my guard up around him.,1
2789,survivorsofabuse,"After I moved out to go to college, he let me know I wasn’t welcome to stay at their house anymore because I “treated them like shit”.",1
2790,survivorsofabuse,I truly hope it finds it's way in the hands of the ones most in need.,1

2795,survivorsofabuse,"When I was 13, i started talking with a girl on an online forum.",1
2796,survivorsofabuse,"Being quite bullied (nothing physical, mostly social stuff, shaming and that kind of jive), I really didn't have alot of people to talk to.",1
2797,survivorsofabuse,"But this girl, man oh man I really liked her.",1
2798,survivorsofabuse,We spoke at first about nothing in special but quickly it got really personal and in depth.,1
2799,survivorsofabuse,"One night, early, early into this, we were kind of flirting.",1
2800,survivorsofabuse,He suggested we shower together.,1
2801,survivorsofabuse,I was scared.,1
2802,survivorsofabuse,Uncomfortable.,1
2803,survivorsofabuse,Not sure.,1
2804,survivorsofabuse,my mom hollered at me to come help with something in the kitchen.,1
2805,survivorsofabuse,I went slowly feeling like I was missing out on the fun.,1
2806,survivorsofabuse,i purpously wasn't being much help to my mom and being the little bitch that I was seeing that she had my brother on her hip as she was trying to get the stuff ready to grill she just waved me away and told me to go on then.,1
2807,survivorsofabuse,so i walked outside and stood on the back stoop and watched.,1
2808,survivorsofabuse,"he smiled at me, and took off his shirt, then his shoes, his socks and then his pants.",1
2809,survivorsofabuse,"Lily is a really nice person (atleast, I'll continue to believe she is), and I think she might be open to it.",1
2810,survivorsofabuse,"Apparently, Mina and Lily have known eachother since childhood.",1
2811,survivorsofabuse,I still think there's a bond there.,1
2812,survivorsofabuse,"I want to look up a professional too, or some kinda of therapist, someone to help her and give her real advice, not my under-educated whims.",1
2813,survivorsofabuse,"If I could get some resources, that would really helpful.",1
2814,survivorsofabuse,"He and I have been pretty ""huggy"" the last couple years, and since he scared me I cut all physical contact off completely.",1
2815,survivorsofabuse,"He didn't try to initiate it today even though we won't be seeing each other for several weeks, so that's something.",1
2816,survivorsofabuse,I don't plan on allowing any of it for the forseeable future - maybe unless I feel like he's really learned something or changed somehow.,1
2817,survivorsofabuse,I don't plan on staying the night at his place or letting him stay at mine.,1
2818,survivorsofabuse,"Probably will limit our contact to public or ""other people present"" for the most part.",1
2819,survivorsofabuse,She used to make me lie in bed with her when my stepdad was gone for the night and she would rub my hair and my ears.,1

2823,survivorsofabuse,"She told me that when I was born, I gave her the best orgasm of her life.",1
2824,survivorsofabuse,"With my therapist's help, I was able to start functioning better, being able to take care of myself a bit better, do certain things for myself, like going into a store solo for errands, without needing someone there as a safety-anchor.",1
2825,survivorsofabuse,"&#x200B; However...  Over those seven years, there's been a lot of turmoil for me.",1
2826,survivorsofabuse,"Nana ended up going through multiple strokes, one of them eventually rendering her righthand hemiplegic, necessitating her moving into a nursing home, which meant her house and assets had to be sold.",1

2828,survivorsofabuse,"Then right after, said “do you think I made you feel like that ever?” Then got noticeably nervous.",1
2829,survivorsofabuse,"Which makes me think of one memory that sticks out as a child (I don’t have too many childhood memories, but I remember this one well).",1
2830,survivorsofabuse,"I was probably 3 or 4, and wearing purple underwear, and I’m pretty sure I fell asleep with pyjamas on, and then in the morning I woke up asking why I didn’t have pyjamas on anymore, and my dad and uncle said “you don’t remember?",1
2831,survivorsofabuse,"We came in when you were in bed last night and uncle _______ held you for a bit” and I remember being super confused because I didn’t remember that, and also, why would they come in and hold me when I was asleep?",1
2832,survivorsofabuse,"Anyway, that memory was weird.",1
2833,survivorsofabuse,"Once I committed mentally to therapy and knew I could pay for it, and that if me and the therapist didn't click that I would keep trying until someone did, the anxiety just got better, in the weeks leading up to therapy.",1
2834,survivorsofabuse,"Once I started and she was so unusually good, I have mentioned it on here before but she really is unusually good, it cemented it.",1

2844,survivorsofabuse,I punched a guy for trying to not use a condom!,1
2845,survivorsofabuse,"I was sexually abused as a teen, and since then advocating for myself -especially in sexual situations- is really difficult for me.",1
2846,survivorsofabuse,"But today I had a guy come over and, when he tried getting off without using a condom **even though he agreed to use one not five minutes before,** I punched him several times off my bed and then a few times more while he was standing up (he's almost double my weight).",1

3209,domesticviolence,Sorry for such a jumbled mess of a post.,1
3210,domesticviolence,Edit: I realize I never expanded on the dissociation or depression.,1

3213,domesticviolence,"That never happened.""",1
3214,domesticviolence,"But there you were, laughing and being affectionate with your newest victim.",1

3224,domesticviolence,"I am ignoring him, that's not what this post is about.",1
3225,domesticviolence,"Basically, after all this time my ex has recently, decided he ""knows"" I cheated on him our entire relationship [I didn't], ""knows"" I'm this chick online who post XXX pictures of herself [I'm not] and has ""reminded"" me of incidences of our relationship that has literally never happened.",1
3226,domesticviolence,"Like, for one example *""...that time I called you from jail, and you cried b/c you were at a guys house and you knew what you did was wrong so you told me you needed help...""* yet he won't show me any evidence (it doesn't exist)...",1
3227,domesticviolence,He's literally fabricating things out of thin air and claiming they happened.,1
3228,domesticviolence,"He isn't denying that he was an abuser, but he's saying like ""You were bad too!",1
3229,domesticviolence,If I hadn’t have grabbed my toddlers head and pressed it against mine and ducked it would have hit us both.,1
3230,domesticviolence,I was yelled at so much I could see the veins bulging in his neck as he swore at me and called me names.,1
3231,domesticviolence,I held my hands over the children’s ears so they couldn’t hear.,1
3232,domesticviolence,But at least he didn’t hit me.,1
3233,domesticviolence,I was told repeatedly that I would be stabbed in the throat so he didn’t need to hear my voice.,1
3234,domesticviolence,"My father has: Keys to a fancy car, like 5 fancy bikes, an iPad, member of a fitness center, goes to the sauna regularily, other women... Needless to say, they should just break up immediately, right?",1

3237,domesticviolence,Which is so frustrating to hear after a while.,1
3238,domesticviolence,"Even more so, when he says things like HE decides when or if they split up.",1
3239,domesticviolence,"He came to the door, drunk and high on opiates (he’s an ex H addict, opiate rage is real), he told me, verbatim, that if there was a guy in the house, he’d kill him on the spot, no questions asked.",1
3240,domesticviolence,That was a pretty easy night.,1
3241,domesticviolence,I’ve spent countless nights barricaded in my bedroom because of his rage.,1
3242,domesticviolence,His past is terrible.,1
3243,domesticviolence,Grew up in gangs (Mexican Mafia) and molested at a young age.,1
3244,domesticviolence,Sorry in advance for what I'm getting off me chest.,1
3245,domesticviolence,"This man sexually, physically, and emotionally abused me for a year.",1
3246,domesticviolence,He even tried to marry me at 16 so he could trap me in his perverted hell.,1
3247,domesticviolence,"After four months of completely breaking free of this sick, twisted human being he had the gall to contact one of my friends to try to get a vinyl back.",1
3248,domesticviolence,He treated me like a dog.,1
3249,domesticviolence,"It's late and I should be sleeping but I can't get my husband out of my head, he's just such a freaking weirdo.",1
3250,domesticviolence,"I feel alone in my situation because most abuse involves some level of anger, but for me my suffering was just his way of showing me affection.",1
3251,domesticviolence,"He would always love to wrestle and tickle torture me, and he wouldn't stop when I was screaming at him to stop I no longer live with him but even today I still get a little flinchy.",1
3252,domesticviolence,"I lived in fear of being tackled, pinned, and tickled on a routine basis.",1
3253,domesticviolence,"I resent him for making me feel so small and fearful and at the same time he made me feel like I was crazy, that I was overreacting.",1
3254,domesticviolence,He says he doesn’t remember this happening.,1
3255,domesticviolence,But he has a short fuse as it is.,1
3256,domesticviolence,"He’s temperamental, out of work, depressed, has a family history of substance abuse, and was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2.",1
3257,domesticviolence,I truly believed this would be “rock bottom” and serve as a wake up call to turn his life around.,1
3258,domesticviolence,It wasn’t.,1
3259,domesticviolence,"I don't know if I'm able to do that, since I didn't tell the doctor the truth to begin with.",1
3260,domesticviolence,"I will say that my doctor very clearly didn't believe me at my follow up appointment, but my bf was in the waiting room.",1
3261,domesticviolence,So I didn't admit to anything.,1
3262,domesticviolence,"I was teary eyed, however.",1
3263,domesticviolence,From anyone's experience- is it worth it to go to the police?,1
3264,domesticviolence,at some point they laughed and i had to leave because i got physically sick to my stomach.,1
3265,domesticviolence,i guess i didn't realize how much they had screwed me up.,1
3266,domesticviolence,now i feel like shit though because the acquaintance is a nice person and i want to be friends with them.,1
3267,domesticviolence,we were all planning a dnd game together over text for a while and i just want to be able to talk to them without thinking about my ex.,1
3268,domesticviolence,any solutions or help ideas?,1
3269,domesticviolence,I'm so used to being forced to submit to him that I no longer have a voice.,1
3270,domesticviolence,He heavily favors my sister over me and would buy her anything she wanted in a heartbeat.,1
3271,domesticviolence,An example would be at Darvin furniture one time.,1
3272,domesticviolence,He takes me and my sister there and tells her to pick out a desk.,1
3273,domesticviolence,I look at a $100 discount desk and he says we don't have enough money.,1
3274,domesticviolence,Both of these were poor choices.,1
3275,domesticviolence,It just exacerbated the situation.,1
3276,domesticviolence,"I had vases, game controllers, tv remote, coffee mugs, etc thrown at me on varied encounters.",1
3277,domesticviolence,This is not an exaggerated list..,1
3278,domesticviolence,"I tried to leave and she blocked the door with her body, threatening to kill herself on one such occassion.",1
3279,domesticviolence,"In his own ways I know he loves me but he's double my body weight, he's a weight lifter, and he has blind rage that only comes out on me of all people .",1
3280,domesticviolence,If I keep gambling he could permanently damage me.,1
3281,domesticviolence,I'm in healthcare I know these numbers so WHY?,1
3282,domesticviolence,I like to believe that he knows his limits when we're fighting but he has scared me and himself in the past.,1
3283,domesticviolence,"Now that chokings are happening during every incident, the accidents could be irreversible.",1
3284,domesticviolence,We ate and he was monitoring my data use because I sent some photos to our friend of her baby shower.,1
3285,domesticviolence,"And he said he ""hates having to watch over me like a father and he wishes I was more responsible"" but said that he ""accepts that this is the way I am"" I said nothing in response to this and just ate my food and let it slide, smiled at him and small talked.",1
3286,domesticviolence,We got back to the park and they had put out a new sign saying they were closed for the rest of the day.,1
3287,domesticviolence,This made him even more mad.,1
3288,domesticviolence,I have never before felt so betrayed by the system.,1
3289,domesticviolence,Fiance (f) was blackout drunk.,1
3290,domesticviolence,"She started getting physical by grabbing my genitals and pulling so hard I now have a 1.5"" tear in my scrotum.. after that I was punched, bitten, scratched, and kicked over the next 5 minutes.",1
3291,domesticviolence,"All I could do was try to retreat, but I was unable to get to our room so I could get dressed and leave the house (I was nude at the time).",1
3292,domesticviolence,"As I got scared she would seriously hurt me, or I would strike her back, I grabbed my phone and dialed 911.",1
3293,domesticviolence,I even pressed chargers against him.,1
3294,domesticviolence,Unfortunately he still found a way through to me by hooking up with girls that I know and having them make sure I knew about it.,1
3295,domesticviolence,Nothing has happened since June and I’m about to be moving far away from him.,1
3296,domesticviolence,I struggle with what he did to me every day and the flashbacks occur still.,1
3297,domesticviolence,I don’t expect this to ever fully go away but I am 18 now and I can say that I survived this.,1
3298,domesticviolence,"I've told her each time to stop, she apologised but doesn't see what the big deal is because she ""hasn't been in love with me for a long time.""",1
3299,domesticviolence,This is when I started to feel awful.,1
3300,domesticviolence,I can't fully figure out why though because Im not in love with her - I probably hate her and haven't realised it yet.,1
3301,domesticviolence,I just feel terrible.,1
3302,domesticviolence,I can barely get out of bed to go to uni.,1
3303,domesticviolence,So now they are querying whether he has a traumatic brain injury suffered a year before we got together and that now he has progressing brain damage.,1
3304,domesticviolence,"At this point my nurse self kicks in, I can't not help someone in that situation.",1
3305,domesticviolence,I feel sorry for him I don't want him to be hurt or alone.,1
3306,domesticviolence,But I also want to hate him and leave.,1
3307,domesticviolence,So my incredibly long winded question to you is this: if he has brain damage is this an excuse or a reason?,1
3308,domesticviolence,"So a bit of long back story here, I was adopted as a child not a proper legal adoption, there was a residency order for me to live with my aunt and uncle for an underdetermined amount of time, after a year my aunt and uncle split and my uncle kept me (my aunt was the one I was actually related to) social services never really got involved past this point.",1
3309,domesticviolence,"My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer.",1
3310,domesticviolence,"My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill, I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.",1
3311,domesticviolence,He would play really loud music on the speaker.,1
3312,domesticviolence,It got so bad when he threw the living room table at me.. we got kicked out of at least 4 apartments.,1
3313,domesticviolence,At this point we were homeless.,1
3314,domesticviolence,"He wouldn’t get a job, and wanted me to get out and hold a sign and pan handle for money, if I didn’t he would drive the car we lived in really fast and say he was going to kill us.",1
3315,domesticviolence,He wrecked that car (small wrecks) at least ten times.,1
3316,domesticviolence,"The husband's voice sounds like pure rage, the wife's both angry and defensive.",1
3317,domesticviolence,A couple of times there were sounds of broken objects.,1
3318,domesticviolence,"We have never really talked (they don't speak good English), so I'm not sure how to approach them about it.",1
3319,domesticviolence,"Calling the police feels excessive, but I'm also worried someone might be abused.",1
3320,domesticviolence,What is an appropriate thing to do here?,1
3321,domesticviolence,"I knew that he was scary when he would pray in front of me, yet the entire thing was an angry ATTACK on God (not trying to get into beliefs here, just what happened.)",1
3322,domesticviolence,"I knew he knew how wrong he was when he told me one day to not tell anyone but that he actually HAD threatened suicide in front of his ex wife with a knife, yet still painted her as the evil doer in the story.",1
3323,domesticviolence,I knew he was lying when he made sure to tell me about how crazy one of his exes went at the end accusing him of rape (why would he even bring it up!!),1
3324,domesticviolence,"and how after he took another ex home from injury while we were together, that she might try to lie to me and say that something happened, but NOTHING did!",1
3325,domesticviolence,"It gave me chills when this man would tell me if his ex wasn't his child's mother he would have had her murdered long ago, and that he had friends offer to help!",1
3326,domesticviolence,Extra: Apparently he was jailed before marrying my mom and he never told us until she found out later into the marriage.,1
3327,domesticviolence,There's more into the story but I would like to know if I can file a charge on him for past incidents as well.... and I am upset that he is going to be charged for misdeamenor instead of felony.,1
3328,domesticviolence,"Since the victim (my mom) has enough evidences, it will be hard for him to drop the charges right?",1
3329,domesticviolence,He has been avoiding the police so it took a while for the police to catch him but he paid for the bail and bailed himself out with a help of his friend.,1
3330,domesticviolence,I just wished he would recieve a felony but he pleaded not guilty on the first court appearance and apparently there are more court appearances to be made befoe verdict is finalized....,1
3331,domesticviolence,I spent six years in a very abusive relationship.,1
3332,domesticviolence,We had a child together.,1
3333,domesticviolence,"After she was born, I made my way out.",1
3334,domesticviolence,I ended up fleeing several houses and apartments trying to stay away from him.,1
3335,domesticviolence,There’s been a long history.,1
3336,domesticviolence,I mean what are you suppose to do when your son is 5 and his older brother who is 16 is picking on him.,1
3337,domesticviolence,He was too big for them to punish.,1
3338,domesticviolence,"So I endured it , some days I hate my whole family for never saying anything.",1
3339,domesticviolence,They just were okay with me being scared of my brother constantly.,1
3340,domesticviolence,Fast forward to me being 18 living with my other brother.,1
3341,domesticviolence,He wouldn't take me to the hospital but I could feel the gaping wound in the back of my head and the hole in my lip my tooth had done.,1
3342,domesticviolence,He kept packing.,1
3343,domesticviolence,So I called the police.,1
3344,domesticviolence,I couldn't see out of my left eye and clearly couldn't drive and felt I had no other option.,1
3345,domesticviolence,The police department chose not to press charges.,1
3346,domesticviolence,If they weren't done he would get angry at her.,1
3347,domesticviolence,After that he would borrow money from her while he was making a lot of money.,1
3348,domesticviolence,"Instead of paying her back, he would spend both his income and her money on things he wanted.",1
3349,domesticviolence,"The next thing was that he would say things like ""I'll do this for you but you'll owe me a blow job later.""",1
3350,domesticviolence,While that worried me the next sign really made me concerned.,1
3351,domesticviolence,I don't know if I should call it abuse.,1
3352,domesticviolence,Fiancé suffers from PTSD & alcoholism... Punched me and threw shit at me at an international airport and almost got himself kicked off the flight.,1
3353,domesticviolence,Last night was the 2nd time but far worse.,1
3354,domesticviolence,He beat me with a bag he thought I packed and thought I was going to leave him (it was a bag I forgot to unpack and was in the closet).,1
3355,domesticviolence,My head was bleeding profusely and I (thank goodness) ran outside and called for help...,1
3356,domesticviolence,He causes emotional pain to me every day but I cannot get myself to leave him.,1
3357,domesticviolence,He physically abuses me sometimes but it rarely leaves a mark or bruise.,1
3358,domesticviolence,I feel like even if he cheats on me (again) I still won’t want to leave him.,1
3359,domesticviolence,The only way I think I will leave him forever is if I end up hating him.,1
3360,domesticviolence,And the only way I will hate him is if he caused physical harm that I cannot lie my way out of like I have in the past.,1
3361,domesticviolence,"""I understand as a woman why you are doing this.",1
3362,domesticviolence,"But as a mother, I am begging you not to press charges.",1
3363,domesticviolence,It will ruin his life.,1
3364,domesticviolence,"Please, let us take care of him.",1
3365,domesticviolence,We'll set him straight.,1
3366,domesticviolence,- kicked me out of the house and was going to make me leave in the middle of the night multiple times while insulting me and hitting me I'm sorry to even post this here but I need a little support right now.,1
3367,domesticviolence,He said this to me two nights ago and came into our guest bedroom where I was sleeping the next day and said sorry Kind of.,1
3368,domesticviolence,I tried to talk to him about it and he said he was under a lot of stress and that he doesn't need my love or support and he doesn't want to talk about it.,1
3369,domesticviolence,Super sorry for the fucked up formatting but y'all get the idea...,1
3370,domesticviolence,I need to know what to do.,1
3371,domesticviolence,"A psychopathic family member was promised MY house, for some strange fucking reason, for apparently a very long time now.",1
3372,domesticviolence,"I have an abusive ex, that won’t leave me alone and his parents say escape and live with them, but he most likely will follow me where I go.",1
3373,domesticviolence,He told me he would.,1
3374,domesticviolence,Should I get a restraining order before I go?,1
3375,domesticviolence,"My ex sent me a video of a switchblade, I asked him why he had that and he said “cutting people up” and then he said “it’s an Italian style switch blade”.. I’m Italian... Anyways, he’s put a loaded gun to my head in the past.",1
3376,domesticviolence,I’m actually pretty terrified of him now.,1
3377,domesticviolence,He also once brought explosives to my brothers house and claimed he “forgot they were there”.. none of my family or our friends growing up believed me when I told them about him.,1
3378,domesticviolence,Which is why I can’t talk to anyone.,1
3379,domesticviolence,"I feel sad for you, I feel sad for me.",1
3380,domesticviolence,"I pray that you will get the help you so desperately need so that nobody else has to endure the terror and horrible horrible physical, sexual, and emotional abuse you have put me through.",1
3381,domesticviolence,I am riding myself of all my shame associated with what has happened.,1
3382,domesticviolence,"I know now, it was all you.",1
3383,domesticviolence,I did not do anything wrong to deserve the horrible treatment I received from you.,1
3384,domesticviolence,It feels as if no one understands what I’m going through in my life because I took a while to leave and didn’t tell anyone until now.,1
3385,domesticviolence,I really didn’t think it was that bad.,1
3386,domesticviolence,"Now that I’m out of the situation, it still haunts me.",1
3387,domesticviolence,I feel guilty and still like it’s all my fault somehow even though it’s irrational and not true.,1
3388,domesticviolence,Does anyone else feel like this?,1
3389,domesticviolence,"For example, she once tried to stab her mum's boyfriend because she didn't want her mum to be with anyone - they were in their mid 60s.",1
3390,domesticviolence,"She has been in a lot of fights over the years, but in general isn't usually physically violent - it's usually manipulation.",1
3391,domesticviolence,I'm concerned because she found out last night that he is seeing this ex gf of his.,1
3392,domesticviolence,"He doesn't know how she found out - he's kept it very, very private.",1
3393,domesticviolence,She came back to the house they used to share (he was there with their kids in bed while she had been out) and lost it with him.,1
3394,domesticviolence,I had bought our son a special outfit themed from the movies just for this occassion.,1
3395,domesticviolence,"Neither of us got much sleep that night, and when I tried to talk to him in the morning about leaving, he got really agitated and raised his voice to me.",1
3396,domesticviolence,Our daughter ran into her room and I found her hiding under her covers.,1
3397,domesticviolence,"After again trying to talk to him, he ended up refusing to go, I'm still not sure why.",1
3398,domesticviolence,"He then ignored me for days again, we again briefly made up for my son's birthday, and started fighting again not long after.",1
3399,domesticviolence,Every time I tell him to leave he threatens to harm my pets or take them and release them to the wild (I have ferrets.... they CANNOT survive in the wild where I live) or he goes into rants about how useless I am and how I couldn't survive without him and somehow he worms his way back in for fear he might be right.,1
3400,domesticviolence,TLDR; need him out.,1
3401,domesticviolence,He threatens animals.,1
3402,domesticviolence,**REALLY** don't wanna involve police.,1
3403,domesticviolence,What do I do?,1
3404,domesticviolence,"Not because I didn’t have evidence, but because none of the evidence was permissible in court.",1
3405,domesticviolence,My last order of protection was denied.,1
3406,domesticviolence,I’m a survivor of childhood incest.,1
3407,domesticviolence,It just seems like no one cares or wants to care about the psychological repercussions any of this abuse has on people.,1
3408,domesticviolence,And I’m the one to blame for not being a perfectly normal person.,1
3409,domesticviolence,When it is his weekend off).,1
3410,domesticviolence,He grumbles and yells only on his 'nervous' days.,1
3411,domesticviolence,Maybe once a week.,1
3412,domesticviolence,Sometimes three days in a row.,1
3413,domesticviolence,Sometimes it is two weeks of not yelling.,1
3414,domesticviolence,Is this what a guy who loves you deserves?,1
3415,domesticviolence,Is this my punishment for life?,1
3416,domesticviolence,Doesn’t some part of you feel something for me?,1
3417,domesticviolence,"I see you and Jane are out tonight so as I sit here alone and dying inside knowing that the most important thing in my life is leaving me and I’ll never even see you again, doesn’t something inside you feel just a morsel of empathy and reciprocal love back for me and to me and want to give me some chance?",1
3418,domesticviolence,Why do I have to be destroyed for this?,1
3419,domesticviolence,And we are almost out of groceries until food stamps come in on the 3rd.,1
3420,domesticviolence,I don't know what to do without him but I'm covered in bruises and in so much pain.,1
3421,domesticviolence,I am worried because my 9 year old watched the whole thing and was so scared she was shaking.,1
3422,domesticviolence,Sorry this is so long.,1
3423,domesticviolence,I guess I just needed to vent.,1
3424,domesticviolence,I beg him to let go of me so I can get my phone and call my dad.,1
3425,domesticviolence,I bang on the floor and scream for help to try to get the downstairs neighbours' attention.,1
3426,domesticviolence,"He mocks my crying and tells me he's not doing anything to me, that I'm freaking out over nothing.",1
3427,domesticviolence,"We're struggling against each other, his elbow hitting my face, his arm occasionally choking me.",1
3428,domesticviolence,"I fight hard to inch towards my phone to get help, but any time I get close he grabs my phone and throw it out of my reach.",1
3429,domesticviolence,""", ""how about reasoning with him on that?",1
3430,domesticviolence,""", ""it's understandable that he is threatened by your new friendships with other women and he handles it by getting angry""...",1
3431,domesticviolence,I am not being critical but I really don't think my therapist knows how to handle what I'm dealing with.,1
3432,domesticviolence,"I said to him yesterday, ""how can I sit down and have a rational conversation with someone i don't feel safe around at times?""",1
3433,domesticviolence,"Have others experienced therapists who weren't helpful, or who coached you to behave in ways that would work with someone who was not abusive, and possibly put you in more danger?",1
3434,domesticviolence,I cook and clean every night and this is expected now.,1
3435,domesticviolence,she berates my family (yeah my family is screwed up!,1
3436,domesticviolence,but show me a family that isn't) and will freak out the moment I critiscise hers.,1
3437,domesticviolence,she demanded I leave immediately this morning so had no time to pack belongings and arrange somewhere for myself and my cat to stay.,1
3438,domesticviolence,"today since being kicked out, just over 12 hours, I have received over 300 phone calls and over 1000 texts via all forms of communication.",1

3440,domesticviolence,"did you do something wrong?"".",1
3441,domesticviolence,The only thing I got from the police was a worn out looking card to the social work department (and by the way they offer counselling - nothing else).,1
3442,domesticviolence,"To this day, they have not arrested him because apparently the attack occurred in the middle of two districts (apparently it's really hard to determine which district is responsible) and because of bureaucratic issues, the man has not been taken to questioning.",1
3443,domesticviolence,"My mother helped me tremendously by arranging the divorce for me, and in the divorce, we did not put any alimony.",1

3448,domesticviolence,By a lie.,1
3449,domesticviolence,I'm male and i live with my partner of 4 years.,1
3450,domesticviolence,We have a 12 month old baby boy who is a very loved and cherished child.,1
3451,domesticviolence,"Early on in our relationship there were a couple of events that looking back i should have treated as red flags, basically my partner reacted volcanically to some fairly normal behaviour on my part such as messaging with a female friend (actually wife of one of my old mates) and me trying to arrange to meet my friends from home for beers (i live a couple of cities away from my home town).",1
3452,domesticviolence,I wrote this stuff off as isolated incidents and we eventially bought a place together and decided to start the family we'd both always dreamt of.,1
3453,domesticviolence,The pregnancy was kind of a beautiful bubble of love and anticipation and i was (and still am) elated by the arrival of our little boy.,1
3454,domesticviolence,"I don't want a situation to come where she calls the police lying saying I hit her (anytime a domestic incident happens, it's automatically the guy's fault) She's called the police falsely on my dad twice, so I wouldn't put it passed her.",1
3455,domesticviolence,So I'm writing this in the parking lot of my college afraid to go home.,1
3456,domesticviolence,Awesome,1
3457,domesticviolence,"I legitimately do not know anyone who has survived this, and I feel like i'm not even human any more.",1
3458,domesticviolence,"As I type this, i'm sobbing, because it's all just so FUCKING truly disheartening.",1
3459,domesticviolence,I used to be a person.,1
3460,domesticviolence,I feel like a ghost now.,1
3461,domesticviolence,"Are there any steps I can take at all whatsoever to start my turn back into normalcy, or am I trapped inside of this until I either die or claw my way out of whatever hole i've fallen into?",1
3462,domesticviolence,?,1
3463,domesticviolence,What if I am at a friends party and a man whispers in my ear that he likes to stare at me so he can touch himself later....but he is dating my friend and he knows I don’t want to upset her??,1
3464,domesticviolence,?,1
3465,domesticviolence,What if I am in the car with a man and some lady cuts him off and he gets road rage and says he wants to “drag her out of the car by her hair and cut her nipples off” but then later says he “obviously didn’t mean it”??,1
3466,domesticviolence,?,1

3471,domesticviolence,I don't have any friends anymore.,1
3472,domesticviolence,"Eventually I reported the texts, as they kept coming, and I recieved verbal backlash from his friends for doing it (I live in a small community, running into him or his buddies all the time).",1
3473,domesticviolence,"Then, radio silence.",1
3474,domesticviolence,"I felt minor relief every day I didn't hear from him, or his friends.",1
3475,domesticviolence,"After his second appearance in court, he pled not guilty to charges of uttering threats and assault.",1
3476,domesticviolence,I was shocked.,1
3477,domesticviolence,I once went to the hospital and needed hand surgery so I messaged her when I found out and said “hey mom I’m in the hospital I’m having surgery tonight thought I would let you know.” She never came to visit and she never even asked what kind of surgery it was.,1
3478,domesticviolence,What do I do?,1
3479,domesticviolence,I feel like I’m nothing but I burden and I just wanna disappear.,1
3480,domesticviolence,I rebelled and did my own thing as a teenager because I was so hurt from what I had been through is it normal for her to hold it against me?,1

3490,domesticviolence,I can't prove it but suspect this may have happened to a girl before me.,1
3491,domesticviolence,Is there a way to expose this family?,1
3492,domesticviolence,"And really, that's why I'm typing this post.",1
3493,domesticviolence,"I want to know for certain if I was witnessing a domestic violence incident (feel free to delete this post if otherwise - again, this is a throwaway, so I don't mind), if there's anything I could and/or should have done differently there, and if there's anything I can do to help in case this happens again (which knowing my job, it will).",1
3494,domesticviolence,"I'm wondering if I should have slipped her info to a hotline, or lied about calling the police, or *something* - in the back of my mind, I keep telling myself there was something I could have done here.",1
3495,domesticviolence,Any ideas?,1
3496,domesticviolence,"EDIT:  In case it isn't clear, I DID call the police - I just didn't inform them of my domestic violence suspicions until they arrived, due to what happened between the call and their arrival.",1
3497,domesticviolence,He’s claiming I beat him in that fight.,1

3507,domesticviolence,She hangs up; told me she was going to; but she leaves.,1

3515,domesticviolence,"I feel like if I can help her and choose not to, anything that happens to her becomes my fault.",1
3516,domesticviolence,I refuse to let that happen.,1
3517,domesticviolence,My husband has poor impulse control (his words) especially when he gets angry or frustrated.,1
3518,domesticviolence,I've noticed he often will take out frustration on the dog (he's a rescue who is legitimately hard to manage).,1
3519,domesticviolence,"He's never hit me or hit the dog, but he will often pull the leash too hard and go too far with discipline.",1
3520,domesticviolence,"For example the other day, the dog was having a lot of anxiety and being bad and barking in the car at every dog we passed.",1
3521,domesticviolence,When we arrived home my partner got out of the car and pulled the dogs leash so hard that he fell out the door into his back.,1
3522,domesticviolence,"After I took care of healing my self, my biggest concern has been that he will do it again to another poor woman.",1
3523,domesticviolence,"He is already dating someone new that is even younger than I am, I was already 13 years younger than him, and I am so worried for her that once she passes the 2 year dating mark he will repeat the pattern of abuse just as he has done in the past.",1
3524,domesticviolence,I wish there was a way to at least give women and men the chance to know of what they are getting into ahead of time and then let them make the decision if they think the person is reformed or not before getting trapped in a potentially abusive relationship.,1
3525,domesticviolence,It makes me sick that the pattern of abuse can continue without any transparency.,1
3526,domesticviolence,I wish there was an online database of domestic abusers similar to sex offenders.,1
3527,domesticviolence,The problem is that I have zero support system.,1
3528,domesticviolence,I have a job but I couldonly afford this motel room for a week and my dog followed me on foot for a few miles until we somehow got separated.,1
3529,domesticviolence,He ended up at someone else's home and I want him back so badly.,1
3530,domesticviolence,I have no way to go get him and I'm scared and alone and  I'm a Christian but I need someone to tell me it's going to be ok.,1
3531,domesticviolence,Please.,1
3532,domesticviolence,Im so in love with my wife when she’s happy and herself.,1
3533,domesticviolence,We have everything in common.,1
3534,domesticviolence,But when she becomes abusive and manipulative it’s too much and she says she will change and she’s taking meds now and she booked a counselor but I don’t know if this is more manipulation and lies or if it’s real?,1
3535,domesticviolence,I just don’t know.,1
3536,domesticviolence,She’s had soooo many chances to do this but only after we have separated is she ever actually doing anything about it.,1
3537,domesticviolence,Ask a local representative for help?,1
3538,domesticviolence,What are some steps I can take that I haven't yet?,1
3539,domesticviolence,"I'm scared, and so .... almost annoyed of dealing with this, he was served a protective order way back in October 2017.",1
3540,domesticviolence,Also...how has he repeatedly had so much success with the police?,1
3541,domesticviolence,"It honestly baffles me, which is why I wonder whether he's paying them off (he told me he'd done this while we were together, although that could've been a fear tactic).",1
3542,domesticviolence,"I used to always feel I loved him more than he does with me, that was a common fight.",1
3543,domesticviolence,And it turned out to be sickly true.,1
3544,domesticviolence,"I care so much for that man, I place myself in his shoes and feeling the pain he must be feeling being alone.",1
3545,domesticviolence,"I know this is sick of me, but how do I stop this?!",1
3546,domesticviolence,I shouldn’t feel bad for what he did right?,1
3547,domesticviolence,!,1
3548,domesticviolence,I loved that man so much and tried my best to make it work.,1
3549,domesticviolence,But I have limits.,1
3550,domesticviolence,"And when he was not thinking twice about getting alcohol while we didn’t have even enough money left for milk for our baby, that was my limit.",1
3551,domesticviolence,We had .51 cents in our account and he found that acceptable?,1
3552,domesticviolence,!,1
3553,domesticviolence,I find myself curious if any of you have experienced a partner who with holds sex and affection as part of their abuse pattern.,1
3554,domesticviolence,I mostly read about men who force or otherwise guilt/manipulate their partners to have sex.,1
3555,domesticviolence,My situation is different.,1
3556,domesticviolence,My husband refuses to touch me.,1
3557,domesticviolence,"If I try to initiate sex which I have done many times in the past, he will flat out push me away.",1
3558,domesticviolence,I can't even talk about the day she left me because it was so traumatic.,1
3559,domesticviolence,I can't even admit it to myself.,1
3560,domesticviolence,It was awful beyond words and I can't tell anyone.,1
3561,domesticviolence,How can I see a therapist if I'm afraid I'm going to lose my shit just opening up about that one day?,1
3562,domesticviolence,I feel like it would ruin any progress I've made...I'm afraid I'm going to be hiding forever.,1
3563,domesticviolence,"I won't defend myself, I know I shouldn't have raised my voice and I should have left much much earlier.",1
3564,domesticviolence,I know who I am.,1
3565,domesticviolence,"That said.. Every day, I see a look that tells me a person I know loathes me.",1
3566,domesticviolence,A thin veneer of social platitudes to cover a roiling hatred.,1
3567,domesticviolence,I don't know what to write past this point.,1
3568,domesticviolence,I have been trying to find an answer to this question over 6 months.,1
3569,domesticviolence,My story starts when I changed while my life for the man I loved by believing him that he loves me and moving to California from Israel.,1
3570,domesticviolence,Since I was the one who were going to take the big step I had many concerns yet he always literally begged me to move here... finally I did move here and we got married.,1
3571,domesticviolence,After a while I found out from a Facebook message that he has been cheating on me all those time that he was begging me to move in with him.,1
3572,domesticviolence,I asked him about the message and he lied about it over an hour.,1
3573,domesticviolence,"Weird title I know but I really couldn’t find any other way to describe what I’m feeling and I really struggled to think if I should post this on here or another group So for as long as I can remember I’ve always been attracted to women and only women I had absolutely no interest in men at all A few years back I had my first relationship which was really manipulative and physically abusive and I haven’t been on any dates since then Recently though (like in the last two weeks) it’s accused to me that bar an old crush from before my ex “kinda-sorta” coming back I haven’t found any women attractive at all in a while at least a year and whenever I see someone I would have normally found attractive I just get a nervous/uncomfortable feeling I can’t really describe I’m not sure if this is a response to how my ex used to get abusive if she thought I was attracted to her (like she’d insist I must want to rape her if I called her beautiful for example) and I know for a long time afterwards I felt disgusted with myself if I found someone attractive so this may just be the next step in that, like my mind doesn’t want me to feel bad for finding someone attractive so it stops finding people attractive",1
3574,domesticviolence,He goes in the bedroom and we only have one car so he has to take me to work.,1
3575,domesticviolence,He is just sitting on the bed and I have to be at work in literally 16 minutes (I live close to my work).,1
3576,domesticviolence,I said come on you're going to make me late and he said well find the fucking car keys.,1
3577,domesticviolence,So I started looking then he found them.,1
3578,domesticviolence,Then honestly he was just going on and on and yelling at me and I tuned out what he was saying so I don't even remember.,1
3579,domesticviolence,"This past week he's gotten really bad where he told her she couldn't use the house phone, her cell phone, the computer, the car, or even watch tv.",1
3580,domesticviolence,He even stopped eating food that my mom makes and starting making his own for himself.,1
3581,domesticviolence,Yesterday I atleast bought my mom a new cell phone and added her to my plan.,1
3582,domesticviolence,He hasn't improved in the past week whatsoever.,1
3583,domesticviolence,This was the last straw for me and I want to move out in the next 2 months and ask her to live with me temporarily.,1
3584,domesticviolence,I don’t know what to expect.,1
3585,domesticviolence,I just want to not be so alone.,1
3586,domesticviolence,He is a law enforcement officer in this small town.,1
3587,domesticviolence,I’ve been down this road with him before.,1
3588,domesticviolence,The injuries have never been so severe though.,1
3589,domesticviolence,"Dear reddit, For what I am about to tell you today is not a rant from a ""man"", but a voice of a concerned human being who happens to be male.",1
3590,domesticviolence,Victims of domestic violence who are men are being laughed at and not taken seriously in today's society.,1
3591,domesticviolence,"It seems the society has made up their mind that men could not be victims of female violence because the male is ""much bigger"", therefore the male has some kind of ""agenda"" against the female.",1
3592,domesticviolence,I was punched and slapped in the face two weeks ago by my wife who is 5'2 103lbs.,1
3593,domesticviolence,He came after me a few times so I got away and called cops.,1
3594,domesticviolence,"He was arrested, restraining order in place and he also had unregistered gun and no licence for them so he may be in trouble for that also.",1
3595,domesticviolence,"The hard part is he was good to my son, and now he is abruptly gone which is best, but I am not not sure how to explain to him.",1
3596,domesticviolence,he is six and very sensitive and the spent a lot of time together.,1
3597,domesticviolence,"tl;dr boyfriend got aggressive and is jailed, how to tell young son why bf is gone now and we have to move soon?",1
3598,domesticviolence,"So I drank wine and I started crying and since my husband was constantly telling me that I ruined his life and he regrets being married to me and I'm the devil and blah blah, for the first time in my life I picked up the knife and I thought I should just kill my self.",1
3599,domesticviolence,When my husband saw me he started screaming and snatched the knife away from me and said I am trying to get him into trouble by committing suicide.,1
3600,domesticviolence,He kicked me and spat on me.,1
3601,domesticviolence,I kept on try to explain to him that I can't take him blaming me for everything and he believes everything he says so hard that every works out of my mouth is a lie.,1
3602,domesticviolence,I tried telling him I am trying to fix myself.,1
3603,domesticviolence,"Broken bones, concussion.",1
3604,domesticviolence,"He broke my glasses in half, destroyed my TV and dvd player.",1
3605,domesticviolence,He tore my clothes off but luckily didn't rape me.,1
3606,domesticviolence,He did however scare me so much that I twice defecated in his room.,1
3607,domesticviolence,"The kicks to my face came about every 15-20 mins, when he would work himself up while yelling.",1
3608,domesticviolence,She doesn't pay for my tuition yet constantly puts me down by calling me dumb.,1
3609,domesticviolence,Anyone have any tips on how to survive the next week?,1
3610,domesticviolence,So far I've been playing super loud music in my headphones whenever she tries to come up and say something to me but I'm looking for options that are less likely to end up in my going deaf haha.,1
3611,domesticviolence,Any tips for how I can quickly forge a future without her in my life would be helpful too.,1
3612,domesticviolence,I'm in my third year of college and am hoping to have a job after I graduate but at the moment I feel so chained down to her.,1
3613,domesticviolence,"I think it was last year, we could hear the little girl crying out so loud inside their home, we called the cops.",1
3614,domesticviolence,"This is just a rumor, but our next-door neighbors say that the house is actually under police watch, and that they're drug dealers.",1
3615,domesticviolence,"The dad is some heavily obese man who should probably invest in larger shirts, and he doesn't leave the home.",1
3616,domesticviolence,"There are always cars coming and going from the house, sometimes the same cars, other times cars we've never seen before.",1
3617,domesticviolence,"Ya know, to buy drugs and shit.",1
3618,domesticviolence,He shouldn't be able to do that to anyone else.,1
3619,domesticviolence,I'm just so scared.,1
3620,domesticviolence,"I wasn't perfect either and I'm scared people won't believe me, or he will twist it so he's the victim and I'm the bad guy, although I know what happened was wrong and I have evidence that he knows what he did was wrong.",1
3621,domesticviolence,"Im scared this will ruin my life, but I also can't bear the thought of him doing that to anyone else.",1
3622,domesticviolence,If anyone needs details about what happened I can share,1
3623,domesticviolence,"During the walk she made a lot of threats about how she was going to call the police, put me in jail, even try to get me deported (I'm a LPR.)",1
3624,domesticviolence,She gets vindictive like this but usually calms down.,1
3625,domesticviolence,Due to the threats I called the police to ask their advice.,1
3626,domesticviolence,The officer wanted me to give him her information and I declined.,1
3627,domesticviolence,"Short story, he gave me two options.",1
3628,domesticviolence,"Even as I’m cooking, he’s still screaming in my face, telling me that I’m done at my job and I need to quit now.",1
3629,domesticviolence,"I yell back, something about him not having a job and he grips me up from behind with an arm around my throat, and I grab the knife I was using to cut chicken and tell him to get off of me.",1
3630,domesticviolence,"He lets go, and we scream a bit more.",1
3631,domesticviolence,"I made a smart remark, and he jabbed me in my face.",1
3632,domesticviolence,It busted the inside of my lip and I was bleeding.,1
3633,domesticviolence,"We get no child support and are doing well financially without it and although he is supposed to pay, I leave it alone because he leaves us alone.",1
3634,domesticviolence,"Long story short, I didn't file or ask for supervised visitation, but that's what the courts ordered.",1
3635,domesticviolence,He did that two or three times within a year and haven't heard from him since.,1
3636,domesticviolence,This Friday for the first time in years I realized how much my life has changed and how happy I and my children are.,1
3637,domesticviolence,"Then, of course, I get the curve ball of this message on Saturday evening.",1
3638,domesticviolence,"My father is an alcoholic, and he has been for about 34 years.",1
3639,domesticviolence,"My mom has had to deal with this the entire time, and lately, he has been having parties at their house and drinking up until 3-4am almost every weekend.",1
3640,domesticviolence,"He drinks everyday, and my mother usually comes to me to vent about it.",1

3642,domesticviolence,She’s afraid to leave because he says he’ll accuse her of abandoning the home.,1
3643,domesticviolence,I was completely on my own by 14.,1
3644,domesticviolence,When she felt the cuts on my wrists in the dark on night she asked if I was cutting ?,1
3645,domesticviolence,I said no and she never said anything again.,1
3646,domesticviolence,I could go on and on.,1
3647,domesticviolence,I think she truly believes that because I am an adult now that all the screw ups all the pain I have been through is my own fault.,1
3648,domesticviolence,"I endured months and months of all types of abuse, the final time was when he grabbed an iron gym equipment that you attach to the wall and threatened to hit my pregant stomach with it.",1
3649,domesticviolence,"After all of this, after denying my child, saying he wasnt the father, after taking everything he had from me, i missed an important detail: A witness stood quiet.",1
3650,domesticviolence,"To this day, I think heavily of this, and I fear that karma will get them both (heavens forbid) through the child.",1
3651,domesticviolence,Please.,1
3652,domesticviolence,And November.,1
3653,domesticviolence,And then two weeks ago which resulted in heavy head bruising and another concussion that lasted all of the two weeks.,1
3654,domesticviolence,He kneed me repeatedly on the head and kicked me in the face as well as punched me several times.,1
3655,domesticviolence,I tried to escape.,1
3656,domesticviolence,I tried to get away.,1
3657,domesticviolence,Hi r/domestic violence!,1
3658,domesticviolence,"You guys were recommended by the super supportive guys over at r/twoXchromosomes where I made this post earlier in the week: <url> (tl;dr: I've been facing a lot of personal strife lately, argument on Saturday with my husband resulted in restraining and a hit to the face.",1
3659,domesticviolence,We're both military members.),1
3660,domesticviolence,A few things have happened since last Saturday.,1
3661,domesticviolence,"Original post here: <url> Quick update: my abusive ex, who put forward his candidacy for local council, was elected Friday by acclamation - meaning no one came forward to challenge him, so no election will be necessary, and he is automatically the winner.",1
3662,domesticviolence,He is flush with victory at the moment.,1
3663,domesticviolence,"I have decided to come forward anyways, about the emotional and sexual abuse that I experienced during the relationship.",1
3664,domesticviolence,"I know I may pay a price, for speaking openly in our small community.",1
3665,domesticviolence,"I’m in Florida, can’t find concrete laws that apartment companies will let me off lease because of abuse.",1
3666,domesticviolence,As in me getting my name off lease and him staying here.,1
3667,domesticviolence,My fiancé is mentally and emotionally abusive.,1
3668,domesticviolence,"We have had some physical altercations, like him pushing me down, poking me hard in the chest, him ripping off his shirt and than hitting me with it.",1
3669,domesticviolence,"He’s also broken a few pairs of glasses, a remote control, smashed the hell out of his iPhone, and threw a chair across the room almost hitting his dog.",1
3670,domesticviolence,So he hasn't really hit me since we got back together but he's cruel in so many other ways.,1
3671,domesticviolence,He will call met fat ass (I'm 5ft8 and 130 pounds) and just had our third child.,1
3672,domesticviolence,He tells me I'm ugly and a dumb b****h and tells me I can't do anything right.,1
3673,domesticviolence,He constantly calls me a whore.,1
3674,domesticviolence,He tells me a whore for not kiwearing a bra in our house.,1
3675,domesticviolence,He constantly threaten to take our son and I’ll never see him again.,1
3676,domesticviolence,"Last night, I started a journal less about the abuse and more about my feelings on a day to day basis.",1
3677,domesticviolence,"This morning he hide my meds from me, after an hour I woke him and asked where they were.",1
3678,domesticviolence,He cussed me out and told me he not to talk to him until 1pm.,1
3679,domesticviolence,"Last night, he forced me into our son’s room and as I was trying to escape he slapped my wrist in the door.",1
3680,domesticviolence,So now I'm here not knowing what to do.,1
3681,domesticviolence,I don't want to call the cops because I don't want my mom to get in any trouble for her gambling habits.,1
3682,domesticviolence,So I need some advice for what to do incase something like this ever happens again.,1
3683,domesticviolence,**tl;dr**: My mom cuts her boyfriend because he grabbed her by the throat and I don't know what to do.,1
3684,domesticviolence,"**UPDATE**: After this incident with her boyfriend, my mom wants to move out of the house.",1
3685,domesticviolence,"We will get through this and I am determined, even it means going to a shelter, to get affordable housing, so i never end up in this situation again!",1
3686,domesticviolence,"Ive been financially abused in small ways for almost a year, paying more than my share, while he saved.",1
3687,domesticviolence,Being forced into buying a computer we couldnt afford then had it thrown at me every fight due to credit card he continuously used (kept under 1k) I also was forced to be precise on where i put things especially when cleaning as to not disrupt him.,1
3688,domesticviolence,He hid snacks and 420 from me when I did most of the purchasing.,1
3689,domesticviolence,It's only happened twice and only happens when he drinks.,1
3690,domesticviolence,I love him dearly and want to help/support him.,1
3691,domesticviolence,He cries and says he's sorry and admits that he is aggressive when he drinks.,1
3692,domesticviolence,I'm so heartbroken I don't know what to do?,1
3693,domesticviolence,Is this even considered domestic abuse/violence?,1
3694,domesticviolence,I have been abused mentally and physically by my step-father when being only 7 and it didn't stop until 12 when I moved to Britain and lived there to this day (17 yr now).,1
3695,domesticviolence,Everyday I was told how worthless I was and was getting beat regularly.,1
3696,domesticviolence,However I coped with it.,1
3697,domesticviolence,"At the start when I came to England, I was crying all the time, when I was called stupid, and idiot or was hit by a friend (A kind of a friendly abuse, you know when you just want to annoy your friends).",1
3698,domesticviolence,"Everyone thought I was just a crybaby, not knowing of my past.",1
3699,domesticviolence,I'm not polyamorous at all and he never mentioned being bisexual to me.,1
3700,domesticviolence,I didn't know what to say.,1
3701,domesticviolence,I kinda went into blank smile mode while inside I was getting sick with jealousy.,1
3702,domesticviolence,He never asked if this was okay for him to do this.,1
3703,domesticviolence,So I considered it cheating.,1
3704,domesticviolence,"She wants to do anything she can do to help me, but it's up to the state, not her, to charge me.",1
3705,domesticviolence,"I have, and documented once I got out of jail, a puncture bite on my right hand, a puncture bite on my left inner elbow, deep scratches all over my left arm, The skin on my scrotum was torn (the jail underwear they gave me was soaked at the end of the day) my lip busted open, a chipped tooth, my whole right side of my face red and sore from a dozen punches, and a welt on my left leg from her kicking me.",1
3706,domesticviolence,Now I'm being charged with 4th degree DV and need legal counsel to prove my innocence.,1
3707,domesticviolence,I have no money to hire anyone and am still in shock that I just had to spend 17 hours in jail without given any medical aid in a small cell with 7 other inmates.,1
3708,domesticviolence,I have no criminal record whatsoever until now.,1
3709,domesticviolence,"I know I want to be treated like a human being, and it's very easy for others to say ""YOU NEED TO QUIT YOUR JOB ASAP.",1
3710,domesticviolence,"Stand up for yourself!""",1
3711,domesticviolence,But it's like leaving a bad relationship...so full of uncertainty and tension.,1
3712,domesticviolence,Please help.,1
3713,domesticviolence,I'm clinging onto the last bit of hope I have.,1
3714,domesticviolence,Wtf is wrong with this society?,1
3715,domesticviolence,!,1
3716,domesticviolence,I’m pissed.,1
3717,domesticviolence,I’m angry.,1
3718,domesticviolence,My abuser is a well known coach who has lost his job over our court cases.,1
3719,domesticviolence,I recently got out of a 2+ year abusive relationship and am now going to court against him with domestic violence charges.,1
3720,domesticviolence,"Originally, I was told that I wouldn’t have to testify as there was ample evidence, but now I am being told I must testify about a week from now.",1
3721,domesticviolence,I am terrified to see my abuser in court and I was wondering what I should expect.,1
3722,domesticviolence,Does anyone have any advice for me or can tell me what I should expect at the trial?,1
3723,domesticviolence,Thank you so much.,1
3724,domesticviolence,Tomorrow afternoon my four children and I are leaving my husband.,1
3725,domesticviolence,"After years of emotional neglected, financial control and recently added physical abuse towards my youngest.",1
3726,domesticviolence,I'm scared that even after our planning we will be turned away from the refuge and have to use the little amount savings to rent a cabin.,1
3727,domesticviolence,I'm scared that I'm making the wrong descion.,1
3728,domesticviolence,Even though my 3 older children have developed mental illness over the past year.,1
3729,domesticviolence,I actually do have access to some money where I believe I could pay off at least some of what I owe but I honestly don’t even know where I can get a number for the debts that I owe.,1
3730,domesticviolence,I am afraid to even begin for several reasons.,1
3731,domesticviolence,"1) I am worried I might actually be in legal trouble over this, 2) I am afraid of seeking help from someone who isn’t understanding of my situation and will just be totally horrified about what a mess it is and they will be mean to me.",1
3732,domesticviolence,Are there any counseling resources available to me?,1
3733,domesticviolence,I am NOT looking for a handout I just need help being walked through the steps of what I need to do to resolve this.,1
3734,domesticviolence,Then I started to notice how much of a temper he has.,1
3735,domesticviolence,The first few weeks he was good at hiding it but it started coming out.,1
3736,domesticviolence,He was full of compliments for me but they were pretty generic and he took me on a bunch of dates.,1
3737,domesticviolence,The last few days I was kind of avoiding him and he kind of tried getting controlling.,1
3738,domesticviolence,Yesterday I was going to spend Christmas eve with him and his family and I tried bringing up some major concerns about the way things were going and he flipped out and started screaming and throwing shit.,1
3739,domesticviolence,I lost a child because of this man and i went back for round 2?,1
3740,domesticviolence,Am I nuts?,1
3741,domesticviolence,Why am I so surprised i've come out looking like i've just had 10 round with Tyson?,1
3742,domesticviolence,Advice please - anyone gone through a similar experience?,1
3743,domesticviolence,What did you do?,1
3744,domesticviolence,He has anger issues and he seems like a good guy sometimes (even though i know he's a fucking monster) and i know he's had a bad childhood.,1
3745,domesticviolence,It's even harder because if he does get arrested or something for it my best friend won't have anyone to support her/pay for her tuition or her meals even... her mom doesn't have the money to do that and i think that's why she still stays with them... just so she can support her daughter.,1
3746,domesticviolence,My family would be willing to take her in but we're not doing well w/ money either.,1
3747,domesticviolence,I really want to do something about it but idk what i can do.,1
3748,domesticviolence,He's been horrible to his family since forever.,1
3749,domesticviolence,"I get a text from my brother that was essentially, ""fuck off and die, nobody wants you here anymore.""",1
3750,domesticviolence,"Clearly I need to move out, but the only person I have in my life is my boyfriend, and although we see each other often, we've been long-distance for awhile and it would be a huge adjustment to move almost 100 miles away (although it would be far enough away from them.)",1
3751,domesticviolence,"Although I love him a lot, I don't exactly want the reason that I move in because he's trying to save me.",1
3752,domesticviolence,"I want to move in because I want to start a new life with him, not to run away from the old if that makes sense.",1
3753,domesticviolence,"So, I guess my question is, what do I do?",1
3754,domesticviolence,I’m having a difficult time coping with how my abusive husband is perceived by family and friends.,1
3755,domesticviolence,"He raged at me, then was perfectly calm and collected as we met family for dinner less than five minutes later.",1
3756,domesticviolence,We go to social events and he’s the perfect gentleman.,1
3757,domesticviolence,"He’s kind, caring, funny, charming...",1
3758,domesticviolence,I sit next to him absolutely blank and speechless.,1
3759,domesticviolence,She comes crying to me and formulates a plan to break up.,1
3760,domesticviolence,She talks to Joe about their issues and her will to leave him wilts.,1
3761,domesticviolence,She stays with him.,1
3762,domesticviolence,"Rinse and repeat, except it gets worse over time.",1
3763,domesticviolence,"How can I break the cycle, or help her break the cycle?",1
3764,domesticviolence,If you intervene he will stoop down to the lowest level cursing his sons out with the worst imaginable.,1
3765,domesticviolence,"First the obvious question, is this domestic abuse?",1
3766,domesticviolence,Domestic violence?,1
3767,domesticviolence,Am I imagining this or blowing it out of proportion?,1
3768,domesticviolence,"I'm in Canada, are there any legal avenues we can use to end this?",1
3769,domesticviolence,Another update: I received two messages from random women yesterday.,1
3770,domesticviolence,"It turns out my boyfriend/abuser has been cheating on me, which is not surprising at this point.",1
3771,domesticviolence,"One of them, he went to get us food while I was home with my son, he paid for this woman's family's meal and got her number, and has been asking her out for drinks every couple days.",1
3772,domesticviolence,"She sent me screen shots of their conversations and he said, ""The ring I gave her is simply a gift to the woman carrying my child.",1
3773,domesticviolence,"We have had a rocky relationship and I can not see us as anything more than co-parenting"", then said, ""I don't work well with crazy"".",1
3774,domesticviolence,"She has had wounds on her face once, one doctor saw them, wrote them down, and offered to call the police.",1
3775,domesticviolence,They replied that she'd have to come there by herself and sue her husband.,1
3776,domesticviolence,Which of course did not happen.,1
3777,domesticviolence,"Turns out I get really numb as the only way to not get dragged into this emotional swamp, but is a hell for its own.",1
3778,domesticviolence,Hating every single contact here.,1
3779,domesticviolence,"But I told him that I’m not over it and his response was kinda like “ I feel so guilty, it makes my life hard, I wish you could just forgive me.” So now I feel pressured to forgive him and it’s frustrating because he didn’t give a damn about my feelings when I was 9 and crying my eyes out because I just saw my dad push mom and hit her.",1
3780,domesticviolence,"In fact, I remember him telling me to shut up.",1
3781,domesticviolence,He didn’t give a damn about my brother when he pushed him against a wall to yell at him when he was only in middle school.,1
3782,domesticviolence,And I can’t help but feel like that fueled my brothers heroin addiction that almost killed him and still could cause he recently relapsed.,1
3783,domesticviolence,I’m just so angry and I don’t want to be.,1
3784,domesticviolence,She wont call the cops because her counselor confirmed they would take away her kids (her mother took all but one from her now).,1
3785,domesticviolence,What the hell can i do?,1
3786,domesticviolence,Edit: she said now I can't tell anyone...,1
3787,domesticviolence,"I'd let her hate me if it meant getting her safe, but I have no idea what this could do to the kids.",1
3788,domesticviolence,Very confused.,1
3789,domesticviolence,There are also things he doesn't like.,1
3790,domesticviolence,He doesn't like when my mom go out to go gamble with his money.,1
3791,domesticviolence,"He works his ass off everyday, gives her money to pay bills, and she constantly goes gambling with her friend.",1
3792,domesticviolence,"Yes I do know that my mom is wrong for that, but me and my siblings can't say or do anything as she is our mother.",1

3797,domesticviolence,I feel like an empty shell of a person with no strength to get out of this mess.,1
3798,domesticviolence,This is mostly a rant but does anyone have any advice or words of encouragement?,1
3799,domesticviolence,"The worst situations were forcing me to make a statement I knew was untrue (in order to allow me to get ready for work); becoming sexually rough and chasing me into another room to force himself on me, and rages where I’ve felt threatened.",1
3800,domesticviolence,These things have ruined my trust and love for him over time.,1
3801,domesticviolence,The controls and double standards that are in place are extensive.,1
3802,domesticviolence,So why do I still feel conflicted about leaving?,1
3803,domesticviolence,I guess I need an extra push.,1
3804,domesticviolence,"I live in a high end building and I feel if I were to talk to the people who work in the office they wouldn’t take my name off the lease, that they wouldn’t care.",1
3805,domesticviolence,"I have told a couples therapist and my individual therapist the things he has done in the past, and what he says to me and his actions.",1
3806,domesticviolence,I believe they would vouch for me.,1
3807,domesticviolence,"I also think if I were to say to the office people that I would like to leave before a real scene is made (cops being called, screaming, damage, etc) that they will be more inclined to take my name off lease.",1
3808,domesticviolence,Thoughts?,1
3809,domesticviolence,And I hated him too.,1
3810,domesticviolence,I had dreams of him stabbing me in the chest.,1
3811,domesticviolence,"Eventually I went to my mum, essentially I wanted out, him or me, like a stroppy teenager, and I made her tell me what was going on.",1
3812,domesticviolence,"He'd been making death threats, this time, and the last time too.",1
3813,domesticviolence,He'd kill us all because we'd held him back.,1
3814,domesticviolence,Laundry.,1
3815,domesticviolence,Lots of it.,1
3816,domesticviolence,With my ass still against the door I grab the overflowing laundry basket.,1
3817,domesticviolence,Overturn it.,1

3819,domesticviolence,as a result hes put his hands on me.,1
3820,domesticviolence,He keeps saying im crazy not respecting his space where i keep asking for things to be amicable over and over.,1
3821,domesticviolence,he tells me its my fault that everytime hes done anything to me its because i started it.,1
3822,domesticviolence,I honestly dont know if its true.,1
3823,domesticviolence,Because i kept trying to tell him leave me alone.,1
3824,domesticviolence,She thinks instead I should ask if I can read him how it has impacted me since this has happened.,1
3825,domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
3826,domesticviolence,It's coming up so quickly and I'm feeling a twinge of anxiety as it gets closer.,1
3827,domesticviolence,I keep telling myself I did everything I possibly could and that I should do what feels right to me even if it means I may feel like I'm going backwards at times.,1
3828,domesticviolence,I also have to make a decision on if I want a permanent restraining order or a non violent contact order.,1
3829,domesticviolence,I decided to park behind it to see what their business was.,1
3830,domesticviolence,They called 911 on me.,1
3831,domesticviolence,"I saw the copper stoppers coming and decided to pull in to my driveway, unload my kids and go inside while they dealt with the strange people.",1
3832,domesticviolence,"Well, the were there to deal with me!",1
3833,domesticviolence,And one was walking up to question me while the other followed my children into my house!,1
3834,domesticviolence,"The real irony is that had my dad told the truth about the car, he would be home right now plotting his next scheme, but instead he lied and got caught because of his arrogance.",1
3835,domesticviolence,"The problem we face now, is that there is always the chance my dad might sign the documents and they let him out (he'll probably weasel money out of his youngest brother/my uncle to pay the bail), and then we have to contend with the possibility my dad has something else planned to get us, which he probably does because that's his gig and his only goal in life since his big revelation after the pace maker got put in.",1
3836,domesticviolence,"My dad cannot talk to Bart or Dandy because they are witnesses, and he can't have any communication with my mom either.",1
3837,domesticviolence,"Myself and my brothers are contemplating getting a restraining order of some kind, but given how my dad operates, I'm not sure that will actually protect us from any harm.",1
3838,domesticviolence,"I have an appointment with doctor Doorstall this thursday, probably won't get anywhere but I'm sure he is aware of my dad's situation by now, or will be soon.",1
3839,domesticviolence,It was all so quick and I try and recall now what happened and my brain jumbles up the details but he finally realized what he was doing to me and stopped.,1
3840,domesticviolence,I am a small girl with a very thin build at 5'8 and 125 to 130  pounds maximum and he is a big guy at 6'5 and and 265 pounds and I had no chance of getting him to stop.,1
3841,domesticviolence,He started immediately after hysterically crying because I started to hysterically cry and started to feel like I couldn't breath.,1
3842,domesticviolence,He spent most of the night afterhysterically crying telling me he can't live with himself after this and how he would never put his hands on a woman but something in him just snapped but I don't know how to forgive him or let it go.,1
3843,domesticviolence,I'm still so shocked by what happened I have managed to stop crying and calm down but I don't know how to move on from here.,1
3844,domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
3845,domesticviolence,"The police are no help as I'm usually tossed in the squad car and questioned like a fucking criminal because ""why would she lie?"".",1
3846,domesticviolence,I can't keep the 2400 a month in child support up because I can't get a job (I usually make 3000 a month net) and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be homeless in a few days.,1
3847,domesticviolence,All I want is to help my daughter and make sure she's safe and I've run out of ideas.,1
3848,domesticviolence,Anything you kind folks could think of would be greatly appreciated.,1
3849,domesticviolence,He said he'd take me to my mothers house if I just smoked a cigarette with him.,1
3850,domesticviolence,"I did, but he refused to take me still.",1
3851,domesticviolence,"I continued fighting his hold and he kept saying my name in a gentle voice and telling me to calm down, saying that he loved me and didn't know why I was freaking out, and kept saying, ""you know you're not going to win.",1
3852,domesticviolence,"Go ahead, tire yourself out.",1
3853,domesticviolence,"You know you're not going anywhere.""",1
3854,domesticviolence,I’ve been in an abusive relationship for 3 years now.,1
3855,domesticviolence,"My family had stopped talking to me, and live states away when my boyfriend and I got together.",1
3856,domesticviolence,"The first time I noticed abuse was when he wanted to repeatedly have sex till I was sore, and would get angry if I refused.",1
3857,domesticviolence,It was subtle at first but it scared me.,1
3858,domesticviolence,"As time went on I would here everyday how I was too skinny, I need to gain some weight.. it got to the point to where I would ask questions about why I wasn’t good enough and was depressed ... he would throw a speaker in a room along with me and put stuff in front of the door to where I couldn’t get out.",1
3859,domesticviolence,I got connected with the DV shelter in town to connect to my Crime Victim funds so I don't have to worry about therapy co-pays and I'm filled to the brim with anxiety about class tomorrow.,1
3860,domesticviolence,I'm so tired of this.,1
3861,domesticviolence,I hate that he probably witnessed me plunging into a panic attack.,1
3862,domesticviolence,I hate that he saw that side of me.,1
3863,domesticviolence,I don't want to look weak in front of him.,1
3864,domesticviolence,"A emotional turning point for me was at 16, my dog at the time, a Lovable and super friendly Labrador who was about 3 years, decided to wander out the gate and explore when he drove in after work one evening.",1
3865,domesticviolence,It was a freezing cold night i remember.,1

3869,domesticviolence,He saved me from my family.,1
3870,domesticviolence,I don't want to give up on him because he's never given up on me.,1
3871,domesticviolence,"TL;DR: Boyfriend often has tantrums where he throws objects around the room, but never physically hits me.",1
3872,domesticviolence,Is this abuse?,1
3873,domesticviolence,How do I get help?,1

3876,domesticviolence,"I have marks and bruises all over my arms and back, as well as deep scratches from her fingernails.",1
3877,domesticviolence,"At one point, she had me on the floor, cornered on the steps, repeatedly slamming my head into the wall and shoving a loose key that fell off the keyring into my breast, still trying to get the rest of the car keys out of my hand.",1
3878,domesticviolence,"I'm not saying I didn't retaliate, but I only went to far as to push her away, never hitting her intentionally but more as an act of defense.",1
3879,domesticviolence,He came home from who knows where and he walks in.,1
3880,domesticviolence,I asked him where he had been because i was starting to get worried.,1
3881,domesticviolence,"He was mad, i could see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice.",1
3882,domesticviolence,Next thing i knew he was behind me with his arm around my neck squeezing.,1

3890,domesticviolence,He isn't fulfilling the courts orders that would get him a chance to petition for supervised visitation.,1

3892,domesticviolence,Even writing about it makes it hard to breathe.,1
3893,domesticviolence,Is it silly?,1
3894,domesticviolence,"He ended up grabbing me by the neck with both hands and slamming my head against the wall in the hallway, he threw me the ground I hit the radiator and then he threw a bucket at me that had a toy and DOG SHIT in it (i genuinely don't think he knew there was dog shit in it, he just threw whatever was there...and our dog must have shit in it.)",1
3895,domesticviolence,I didn't pass out this time.,1

3908,domesticviolence,He then grabbed me by my arm and shoved me out the door yelling “take her fucking ass with you.” My friends sat with me for a minute and asked if I wanted to leave with them.,1
3909,domesticviolence,Nobody should ever have to put up with that and have to live in fear of someone who can fly off the handle like that.,1

3922,domesticviolence,He told me multiple times that he accepted it and he loved me regardless.,1
3923,domesticviolence,"However, He has been very abusive, always blaming it on my job before and now that I have retired since our marriage he uses my past against me during every fight.",1

My dog would come out from under the table (she was a rescue who had been abused) and would trip him up, letting me escape, and he'd hold her hostage-- letting me spend most of the night in the cold, out in the boondocks where it was common for truckers to come through and cougars to attack farm animals and pets.",1
3933,domesticviolence,"If he felt sober enough, he would chase me down the road for a few hundred yards, and I would walk the three miles into town and wait in the park by the police station until I was sure he'd passed out...",1
3934,domesticviolence,Why am I feeling like I miss him.. I’ve been okay for 7 damn days & then he texted my grandmother & asked me if I wanted him to mail me my stuff (a card) & now I’m starting to feel bad.,1
3935,domesticviolence,Why is he seeming so decent now... Why do I feel so damn guilty.. why do I feel like I did something wrong.,1

3963,domesticviolence,"he could not understand why i resented him, when in his mind, it was ME who was being 'abusive'.",1

3974,domesticviolence,But I don't want him to suffer.,1
3975,domesticviolence,There have been times when I did.,1

4029,domesticviolence,"A few days before Valentine’s Day, someone sent me screenshots of him talking to a girl on FaceTime or Instagram saying “you’re so cute” and flirting with her.",1
4030,domesticviolence,I decided not to say anything- the girl lived in another state and I didn’t want to bring it up.,1
4031,domesticviolence,I figured she was a fried from when he had hitchhiked across the country when he was in college.,1
4032,domesticviolence,"I waited till Valentine’s Day, and called him up- he told me “I don’t think we should live together, and I just signed a 9 month lease at my apartment.” I was livid.",1
4033,domesticviolence,He brought me 2 dozen roses and I smashed them in front of him in a parking lot.,1
4034,domesticviolence,My tourist visa ends November.,1
4035,domesticviolence,Part of me wants to wait shit out until my green card gets here and then leave him.,1
4036,domesticviolence,"The other part of me wants to walk to my nearest lawyer so that I can hand him divorce papers, and demand money to send me and my dog back home.",1
4037,domesticviolence,"He said If I am wanting to go home, I should pay him back from my credit card the $2000 for immigration paperwork and $600 lump sum CrossFit membership he paid for me.",1
4038,domesticviolence,What to do...,1
4039,domesticviolence,How about that?,1
4040,domesticviolence,"No this isn't just some edgy teen, oh I hate my dad, I have every reason to hate him, for what he has done, and continues to purposely do to me and my family.",1
4041,domesticviolence,"For nearly killing me, for scarring us all to the point I can't even meet a nice person, or have any friends, and not wonder whether they do or don't treat their family like a lump of sh**.",1
4042,domesticviolence,"Nobody needs, nor should they ever have to live the life I have been forced to live.",1
4043,domesticviolence,Nobody should have to call the police because they don't feel safe within their own home.,1
4044,domesticviolence,"I could stay up here alone, but he says he’ll be where ever we are.",1
4045,domesticviolence,I feel trapped and I think it’s making me like I’m acting like a child these days.,1
4046,domesticviolence,At least from my perspective.,1
4047,domesticviolence,He drained my accounts and I’m financially dependent because I fear not paying bills and I have to feed my daughter and myself.,1
4048,domesticviolence,In laws say they can help us...but they’re still his parents.,1
4049,domesticviolence,Something like that happened again.,1
4050,domesticviolence,"He was angry with me and wanted me to go to another room so he didn't have to look at me but I wanted to stay (not getting involved in any conflict or anything, just doing my studying and not interacting) so he took me out of the room by force, not hard again, but I got hysterical nonetheless.",1
4051,domesticviolence,"After calming down I continued my studies in the kitchen, trying not to think of what had happened and where this relationship was going.",1
4052,domesticviolence,In about an hour he came to me and it looked like his anger was unresolved as he was provoking me.,1
4053,domesticviolence,I decided not to get involved because this time I was genuinely frightened of what was going on.,1
4054,domesticviolence,He loves them and treats them like gold.,1
4055,domesticviolence,I love the type of father he is but I hate the way he treats me.,1
4056,domesticviolence,I have no one to open up to or go to if I even tried to leave him.,1
4057,domesticviolence,I’m tired of him abusing me mentally and physically me.,1
4058,domesticviolence,He has cheated on me several times and each time it knocks my self esteem Lower and lower.,1
4059,domesticviolence,I thought I did well but I was severely depressed.,1
4060,domesticviolence,That weekend was my birthday weekend and he made it miserable.,1
4061,domesticviolence,He said I was a brat to ever think that it was a special day.,1
4062,domesticviolence,I received the silent treatment from him and him being drunk and telling me that i'm worthless and don't do anything for him.,1
4063,domesticviolence,I didn't even get a gift or affection.,1
4064,domesticviolence,He backed me into a corner in the kitchen and kept hitting me.,1
4065,domesticviolence,When I fell he stomped on my face and also choked me.,1
4066,domesticviolence,I was trying to hit back but he's much bigger than me.,1
4067,domesticviolence,"When he starting choking me, I bit the holy hell out of his arm to get him off.",1
4068,domesticviolence,"He surprisingly did, after yelling about how it hurt, then went to finish packing.",1
4069,domesticviolence,During a night he came barged into me and my mom's room and started hitting her.,1
4070,domesticviolence,"I was so confuse and in tears I didn't know what to do, but cry.",1
4071,domesticviolence,I didn't get much sleep that night.,1
4072,domesticviolence,The abuse continue on for 4 years.,1
4073,domesticviolence,There was peaceful time I thought the abuse stopped.,1
4074,domesticviolence,(He knows where we live and go to school) My moms in a ton of debt because of my dad.,1
4075,domesticviolence,"Right now both of them have a job but if my dad is no longer working, it's gonna be a lot harder to pay it off.",1
4076,domesticviolence,I also go to a private school which costs a lot.,1
4077,domesticviolence,How do we deal with this?,1
4078,domesticviolence,I just posted my whole story <url> but it's literally too long for anyone to actually read.,1
4079,domesticviolence,I mainly want to know if this would be considered rape: MOST RECENT ABUSE: I worked 7 days in a row and finally had one night off on a Friday.,1
4080,domesticviolence,"I expressed I wanted to spend it with him, but since I went out the night before he was determined to go out with his friends that night.",1
4081,domesticviolence,I guess that also comes with ignoring me all night.,1
4082,domesticviolence,"Not being able to let go of the fact that I let this go on for so long, and even the fact that in my heart I still care and want him.",1
4083,domesticviolence,"In my mind I think ""if only"" or ""what if"" but I know those are facades.",1
4084,domesticviolence,"I know he will never be real, open or honest about who he is or what he did.",1
4085,domesticviolence,"I have to forgive myself for letting this take over my life, my heart, my emotions.",1
4086,domesticviolence,I have to forgive myself for not listening to my gut and my intuition.,1
4087,domesticviolence,Our justice system is not aimed at helping victims.,1
4088,domesticviolence,"I feel totally violated, put down, and blamed for requesting an extension on an order of protection.",1
4089,domesticviolence,Which was denied because he is living in another state.,1
4090,domesticviolence,"Even though, he was unable to show, as he’s out on bond for assaulting a new woman.",1
4091,domesticviolence,"Judge told me, if he harasses you and violates you again, then you can go back through the process to get an order.",1
4092,domesticviolence,He certainly had/has the ability to.,1
4093,domesticviolence,"The worst/best part of this story is that I am still with this prick, trying to get away safely.",1
4094,domesticviolence,Best part is that my story may be horrifying enough to convince women in an early stage DV situation to run before it escalates to my story.,1
4095,domesticviolence,"After the 2nd severe incident, I called family who took me to the ER.",1
4096,domesticviolence,Had lots of tests done.,1
4097,domesticviolence,"No Idea why I am here, guess I just need to vent.",1
4098,domesticviolence,"Well my troubles started last weekend, my parents flew over from Malta to visit my brother whose in hospital.",1
4099,domesticviolence,He is in bad shape and initially he lost the use of his legs few years ago and now his paralysis is rising up to his waste.,1
4100,domesticviolence,So am I headed of to the hospital and stayed up north for the weekend.,1
4101,domesticviolence,I told my gf that she could stay at home rather than spend her time at the hospital with me.,1
4102,domesticviolence,Since I knew him I haven't had active suicidal thoughts.,1
4103,domesticviolence,Even now.,1
4104,domesticviolence,"I hate how I am and I wish I could die right now, but I don't have the drive to do it myself anymore.",1
4105,domesticviolence,How do I leave him if I know that life without him has been and will be a worse circle of hell?,1
4106,domesticviolence,FUCK MY FUCKING LIFE IF I HAD THE MONEY I'D HIRE A HITMAN TO DO ME IN,1
4107,domesticviolence,She does dissociate and is on all kinds of psychiatric meds.,1
4108,domesticviolence,One day she loves me the next day she hates me.,1

4110,domesticviolence,She suffers from  agoraphobia so we never leave the house.,1
4111,domesticviolence,"Its also her place so Im scarred she is going to kick me out, she has used that against me in the past, it makes me feel very vunrable and scared.",1

4113,domesticviolence,My family victim blames and they’re are ok with a multi millionaire pedophile in the family.,1
4114,domesticviolence,So they’re disgusting and no help.,1
4115,domesticviolence,I wouldn’t be surprised if he’ll try to kill me one day.,1

4117,domesticviolence,"As she was leaving she told me ""now I have to go back there again"" as she was sobbing.",1
4118,domesticviolence,I didnt know what to say or what I could do to help.,1
4119,domesticviolence,Everyone I've talked with as told me I should've gotten her phone number because looking her phone number up through our receipts and membership files is an invasion of privacy.,1
4120,domesticviolence,Did I miss my only opportunity to help her by not asking for her phone number?,1
4121,domesticviolence,"Sorry for the sad story, I just don't know what to do and it's painful to think what is happening to her right now.",1
4122,domesticviolence,"Years ago on this day, you did things to me I will not say.",1
4123,domesticviolence,"Although I might have lost a fight, nothing about that at all was right.",1
4124,domesticviolence,"I hope it bothers you oh so much, to know you hurt me all by touch.",1
4125,domesticviolence,"Everything about you is so mean, I just wish you could get clean.",1
4126,domesticviolence,"I wrote this all straight from my heart, take responsibility for your part.""",1
4127,domesticviolence,He was going to choke the name out of me.,1
4128,domesticviolence,I am his 24/7 caregiver i do not have time to cheat even if i wanted.,1
4129,domesticviolence,He said i would die if i didnt tell him.,1
4130,domesticviolence,He snapped out of it.,1
4131,domesticviolence,That was a couple days ago and i am finding out how close i really came to dying.,1
4132,domesticviolence,He's been violent pretty much since 6months in.,1
4133,domesticviolence,Nothing too horrendous at first just a slap or a punch or he'd spit in my face during an argument or grab me.,1
4134,domesticviolence,I reasoned I could deal with that because he was always so remorseful and depressed afterwards.,1
4135,domesticviolence,"A year in we split up because he stole my car keys out of the ignition, got in the car and threatened to kill me rip out my hair and nails etc.",1
4136,domesticviolence,I went to the police and they issued him with a domestic violence order.,1
4137,domesticviolence,Today i came home from and the girls were up and had the Halloween candy all over the room.,1
4138,domesticviolence,Their dad was sleeping alongside them.,1
4139,domesticviolence,"After a couple minutes of ""bitching"", he says to my oldest, tell your mom to shut up.",1

4142,domesticviolence,"Everytime, he gets mad he takes my phone or other items away from me and tells me he bought it so it's his.",1
4143,domesticviolence,He's even broke my iPhone which I bought a long time ago.,1
4144,domesticviolence,"He doesn't give me money and if I want some, I need a good reason why.",1
4145,domesticviolence,"He works overnights which makes things very hard for me, because the Long island railroad barely runs during those times and even then I have a 2months old, where would the baby and I go overnight?",1
4146,domesticviolence,"I don't know what to do, but I'm tired of feeling trapped and helpless.",1
4147,domesticviolence,"It’s subconscious for sure, but just a feeling I get.",1
4148,domesticviolence,"I’m terrified of him, and praying that he gets the real help he needs at the same time.",1
4149,domesticviolence,And I just don’t know how to sort that out.,1
4150,domesticviolence,"I don’t know how to stop worrying and wondering what he’s doing, we have several court dates coming up so I think that adds to it.",1
4151,domesticviolence,I’m just so exhausted and ready for this fight to be over.,1
4152,domesticviolence,My friends and family don't understand why he is so jealous and controlling because they know when I'm in a relationship I'm faithful.,1
4153,domesticviolence,"Im ready to take him out of my life, but what should I do?",1
4154,domesticviolence,When hes angry I don't know what extent he would go to.,1
4155,domesticviolence,How should I handle it?,1
4156,domesticviolence,Ignore him or communicate calmly so he doesn't get mad?,1
4157,domesticviolence,All of this has made me feel really horrible.,1
4158,domesticviolence,"It has destroyed my self esteem and made me feel depressed, unlovable, worthless, responsible, etc.",1
4159,domesticviolence,It has also had severe and debilitating impacts on my mental and physical health.,1
4160,domesticviolence,Accounts incredibly overdue.,1
4161,domesticviolence,"A life entirely unattended to, without organization or care.",1
4162,domesticviolence,Chaos.,1
4163,domesticviolence,I knew none of this.,1
4164,domesticviolence,"The man he presented to me was one of principle (honesty, loyalty, your word is your bond, etc), always ready to protect and serve in whatever way necessary.",1
4165,domesticviolence,"It was a big company so luckily I didn't have to see him all the time, but when I did, he again acted as though I didn't exist.",1
4166,domesticviolence,"I tried to talk to him and update him on the pregnancy, and ask him to be involved for our child's sake, and he literally stared right through me without saying a word.",1
4167,domesticviolence,"3 months after our daughter was born, I texted him and told him he was missing out on the most amazing person in this world, and how it wasn't fair to her.",1
4168,domesticviolence,"To my surprise, he wrote back and wanted to see her.",1
4169,domesticviolence,"He apologized, said he had changed and within a couple of months, we were engaged.",1

4173,domesticviolence,"We've had a toxic relationship, but mostly loving.",1

4176,domesticviolence,Husband finally says he'll watch our darling for the few hours between his full night's sleep and work.,1
4177,domesticviolence,So we're doing this.,1
4178,domesticviolence,"I'm chipping on an embroidery project doing 'me' time, he's on bed with baby keeping the crawling fiend busy.",1
4179,domesticviolence,He falls asleep and baby almost falls into crack between headboard and wall.,1
4180,domesticviolence,"Even when (now talking about other times) I tried to be playful and like scare prank him, he would beat me up for it.",1
4181,domesticviolence,And I still looked up to him for some reason.,1
4182,domesticviolence,I believe no child should ever experience these kinds of things.,1
4183,domesticviolence,They always drag themselves into your future life.,1
4184,domesticviolence,"In my case, I have sworn to myself to never become like my father, but I still have these... well, issues.",1
4185,domesticviolence,We added a bunch of [security <url> for specific scenarios.,1
4186,domesticviolence,"If you're more comfortable keeping things on reddit, we put a lot of the same information on r/operationsafeescape.",1
4187,domesticviolence,"Either way, if you feel your computer's being monitored, check out our [secure <url> guide.",1
4188,domesticviolence,"Also, we're hosting our first <url> in October.",1
4189,domesticviolence,"We've also been busy building up partnerships in the security sector, which will allow us to bring even more resources to the audience we serve.",1
4190,domesticviolence,"When I asked her how it happened, she said her brother had accidentally elbowed her in the face when they were 'rough-housing'.",1
4191,domesticviolence,There was something about the way she said it that seemed a bit off to me - like she had been practising her excuse (or maybe that was in my head).,1
4192,domesticviolence,Whatever the case it struck me as maybe a little weird that a couple of 20-something siblings would be play-fighting with each other like 10 year olds.,1
4193,domesticviolence,"This morning, after an absence of several days, she arrived at the office with a broken wrist.",1
4194,domesticviolence,Her arm is in a cast and she has metal rods holding the broken bones in place.,1
4195,domesticviolence,"It was the summer, I had just started a new job as a bartender.",1
4196,domesticviolence,"I met a girl that was equally odd, had a lot of similar interests, was looking for the same thing I was.",1
4197,domesticviolence,We quickly became enamored with each other.,1
4198,domesticviolence,It didn't take long for us to move in together.,1
4199,domesticviolence,"I started finding projects around the house to fix up, she would surprise me with home cooked meals or a note gushing over our relationship.",1
4200,domesticviolence,u mind you my mom is 5’1 and he is 5’9.,1
4201,domesticviolence,now her jaw hurts and pops when she opens it wide.,1
4202,domesticviolence,so this is my dilemma: i am a very emotional person.,1
4203,domesticviolence,my emotional skin is raw and any slight change in others affects me greatly.,1
4204,domesticviolence,side note: i had developed ptsd growing up from being scared of my older brother (saw him and heard him fighting with my family many many times growing up) but since he moved out for good (i hope) its gone away.,1
4205,domesticviolence,Throwaway because my normal account is a common username for me....,1
4206,domesticviolence,"Anyway, I've been in a lesbian relationship for near 7 years.",1
4207,domesticviolence,The first 2 was long distance but then i moved from NY to TX to be with her.,1
4208,domesticviolence,Everything was generally okay until we moved into a new apartment back in December.,1
4209,domesticviolence,It isnt the best but its a roof over our heads and it's relatively cheap.,1
4210,domesticviolence,Things were so good again.,1
4211,domesticviolence,Just like the beginning.,1
4212,domesticviolence,Then the yelling comes back.,1
4213,domesticviolence,I got really sick and had to go to the hospital and he refused to come and visit me when I was home.,1
4214,domesticviolence,He told me I was dense for expecting him to come hang out with me when I have such a deadly disease (it was MRSA and not that deadly).,1
4215,domesticviolence,"She requested to go to the bathroom right away, and we helped her with that.",1
4216,domesticviolence,The husband/driver was out loading all our parts when she finally came out of the bathroom.,1
4217,domesticviolence,We asked her what is wrong.,1
4218,domesticviolence,"She said, ""He grabbed me by the neck and hurt me.",1
4219,domesticviolence,"I don't think I can go back with him.""",1
4220,domesticviolence,I dial.,1
4221,domesticviolence,000.,1
4222,domesticviolence,I have never used that number before.,1
4223,domesticviolence,How does this wor….,1
4224,domesticviolence,"“Emergency: Police, Fire or Ambulance?”",1
4225,domesticviolence,"Not like triggers per say, because I'd have to ask her about that, but more general behaviors.",1
4226,domesticviolence,"Like, if I see her acting in a certain way that is common to abuse victims, I should know to be careful around that.",1
4227,domesticviolence,Like apologizing a lot is a common behavior.,1
4228,domesticviolence,"Knowing about the abuse, I didn't try and correct her or anything (save one time when she thought she was bothering me, and I told her she will never be able to do that).",1
4229,domesticviolence,So any additional information is useful.,1
4230,domesticviolence,Everyone loved him.,1
4231,domesticviolence,He told the best stories and cooked the best food and was funny.,1
4232,domesticviolence,All my friends thought he was the coolest person ever.,1
4233,domesticviolence,He also has untreated bipolar disorder.,1
4234,domesticviolence,Anyway - back in December he hit her so bad (using an object) that the next day she passed out at work and her coworkers forced her to get medial attention ) - she went the hospital - her sister went to meet her - and because it was mentioned that a minor lived in the house - social workers and the police got involved.,1
4235,domesticviolence,They were too caught up in their anger.,1
4236,domesticviolence,My grandmother would tell me stories about having to be the one that cleaned the blood from the walls.,1
4237,domesticviolence,She thought I might be mentally handicapped because I wouldn't make a sound when all of this was going on.,1
4238,domesticviolence,My brother was three years older than I was.,1
4239,domesticviolence,My mother left my father when I was two.,1
4240,domesticviolence,"Quick background: I left this guy back in 2006 after three years, and also turned him in for possession of child pornography and talking to a tween online and getting nudes from her.",1
4241,domesticviolence,"He plead guilty to Sexual Exploitation of a Minor, avoided federal charges but was put on the sex offender registry in that state.",1
4242,domesticviolence,I just found out that he died in March of this year.,1
4243,domesticviolence,Stage 4 cancer.,1
4244,domesticviolence,"It had metastasized by the time they found it, nothing they could do.",1
4245,domesticviolence,I'm leaning more toward not responding but I haven't been able to let it go.,1
4246,domesticviolence,"I'm not sure what she even wanted, other than to talk to me before make a big decision for and her kids.",1
4247,domesticviolence,"I got a message pleading for a conversation, no explanation as to what.",1
4248,domesticviolence,She apologized and stated that she wasn't trying to cause problems.,1
4249,domesticviolence,"She said he was in prison for something that happened a long time ago (looks like he was on felony probation and did something to get it revoked), sent pictures of her children, who are all one year older than the children him and I share, and told me his mother had passed.",1
4250,domesticviolence,Things between us were amicable until that point.,1
4251,domesticviolence,"Now, the atmosphere is VERY different.",1
4252,domesticviolence,"It hurts now because she's acting indifferent and like she's totally unaffected (which she might well be, I don't know if she's pretending).",1
4253,domesticviolence,"Shes already moved on to someone else, someone she's liked for a while, her boss.",1
4254,domesticviolence,She has tried three times to bring her up and talk to me about her.,1
4255,domesticviolence,#NAME?,1
4256,domesticviolence,"When I was 16 I met a guy on vacation 11 years my senior... Having never been able to get along with those in my age group, I thought nothing of somebody older spending time with me, as I had grown up always spending my time around the adults during the holidays or my older brother's friends...",1
4257,domesticviolence,"Looking back now, I know this was naive and innocent on my part, nothing that anyone could or should blame a young kid for, as I really thought I was an outcast amongst my peers.",1
4258,domesticviolence,"And while it may have been true, there is no reason or excuse for a 27 year old man to want to be with a 16 year old girl except that he couldn't find a woman his age who would fall for his games and lies...",1
4259,domesticviolence,He played nice for my vacation-- respecting my boundaries and acting only as a friend.,1

4268,domesticviolence,THIS IS IT!!!!,1
4269,domesticviolence,"Fast forward , she goes a little further this time and consults an Attorney Firm.",1
4270,domesticviolence,"She always said money was problem , and me being an idiot said I dknt care I'll make a plan so that this evil doesn't have to be in our lives, She calls Me to say that the Attorneys need $250 for an Eviction Letter to him.",1
4271,domesticviolence,He said he’d never love us.,1
4272,domesticviolence,He acknowledges and plays with his daughter starting after she turned 6 months.,1
4273,domesticviolence,He use to threaten to take her away from me.,1
4274,domesticviolence,He gets delusional at times and he yelled at me “I’m going to off myself if you don’t admit that you were going to call the cops on me for calling the manager at McDonald’s an asshole!” I filmed it.,1
4275,domesticviolence,"So he said, “here’s your daughter try not to off yourself” He really thinks I’m going to kill myself for no reason....",1
4276,domesticviolence,"So I have a buddy who still lives with his step dad, mom, and brother.",1
4277,domesticviolence,"Long story short, I just found out through him that his step dad hits him and occasionally his mother.",1
4278,domesticviolence,It came out when he was drunk along with other behaviors.,1
4279,domesticviolence,When my friend gets drunk he likes to aggravate people until they try to beat him up and until recently I just thought he liked fighting.,1
4280,domesticviolence,But he told me it is because his step dad hits him so getting in fights gives him a weird sense of worth.,1
4281,domesticviolence,She gave birth to a beautiful baby girl in Nov 2017.,1
4282,domesticviolence,Her partner is 26 yrs old and has had many bouts with the law.,1

4284,domesticviolence,They worked together and soon began dating.,1
4285,domesticviolence,My friend is a Filipino woman and her partner is a Jamaican man.,1
4286,domesticviolence,And it’s okay to fall down and have a bad day- as long as you pick yourself up and continue working toward moving forward.,1
4287,domesticviolence,Moving forward does NOT mean forgiving and forgetting or condoning any behaviors.,1
4288,domesticviolence,Moving forward is about YOU and beginning to live the life YOU deserve.,1
4289,domesticviolence,You are beautiful.,1
4290,domesticviolence,You are smart.,1
4291,domesticviolence,"Anyway, he bullshited that her insurance wasn't covered  by anyone in this state, and that it was illegal for him to refuse her her shift.",1
4292,domesticviolence,My SO had already talked to his HR head.,1
4293,domesticviolence,They had previously decided that there wasn't much they could do unless she came up to him.,1
4294,domesticviolence,"Then tonight happened, the head of HR is severely worried for her safety (and my SOs) in a way he wasn't before.",1
4295,domesticviolence,"The head has called the Domestic Violence Hotline himself, and is looking for resources to help him solve this very delicate/tricky issue.",1
4296,domesticviolence,put the world on my middle finger and tell it to sit and spin?????,1
4297,domesticviolence,?,1

4299,domesticviolence,if you have a family that loves you please treat them right -- because there's people like me out there who would give anything to have what you have  -- don't take it for granted,1
4300,domesticviolence,"And I found as I got older, I always turned to women for support.",1
4301,domesticviolence,"My first marriage didn't work out, but I tried.",1
4302,domesticviolence,"And my second has been beautiful, we've been together for nearly 18 years, married for 16.",1
4303,domesticviolence,"We still have a lot of fun and while she doesn't understand what we went through first hand, she's perfectly supported me and we've built a good life together.",1
4304,domesticviolence,My mum never had another relationship.,1
4305,domesticviolence,"I was in a relationship, so I didn't really let it go anywhere, but hell, it was a new experience for me, and I liked being liked.",1
4306,domesticviolence,Fast forward half a year to my breakup.,1
4307,domesticviolence,"She had moved to a different job, but we bumped into each other in Wal-Mart, if all places.",1
4308,domesticviolence,"We hit it off, and it wasn't long before a date turned into two, then more.",1
4309,domesticviolence,"I moved in with her, but maintained a separate apartment for a few months at her request (her family was very judgemental about 'living in sin').",1
4310,domesticviolence,His mom and aunt like me too.,1
4311,domesticviolence,"But there have been some dark portions of our relationships, which I am ashed to talk about.",1
4312,domesticviolence,"First of all, the lightest part - when he is nervous because of something, he lashes out on me in shape of harsh criticism.",1
4313,domesticviolence,Or he yells.,1
4314,domesticviolence,'You always stare at your phone!!!',1
4315,domesticviolence,"To start, I feel like I should share why I wanted to be here today to read this statement myself.",1
4316,domesticviolence,"For six and a half years, I was in a relationship with Luis.",1
4317,domesticviolence,"The first time he physically assaulted me, I was 18.",1
4318,domesticviolence,That was the first time I had been knocked unconscious by another human.,1
4319,domesticviolence,The choking incident that we are here for today was the first incident of domestic violence that I reported to the police.,1
4320,domesticviolence,"As an aside, it really kind of messes you up when the DA calls and tells you that in less than a week your abuser will be putting in a final plea; if you'd like to attend, please come for at least half a day to see what will happen.",1
4321,domesticviolence,"So, talked to my therapist about this and I had already told the DA I want him to see jail time not just 2 years of probation with state mandated drug treatment.",1
4322,domesticviolence,isn't this also really awful as now they'll just forever say it was because of their addiction and never take full responsibility for their own actions?,1
4323,domesticviolence,"I digress, I demanded that he gives me a face to face apology.",1
4324,domesticviolence,My therapist thinks it might be a bad idea as it's been less than a year and she thinks he will only lie and tell me he's sorry because I've requested it.,1
4325,domesticviolence,"My sister messaged me ""CALL ME ASAP"" I received her message at 1am when I woke up at my own home to use the restroom.",1
4326,domesticviolence,"I called my sister at that time, she answered the phone and I heard yelling and screaming.",1
4327,domesticviolence,"What happened was, My sister gave my father a ride back to wherever it was he came from - to get him out of their home.",1
4328,domesticviolence,My father would not leave my moms home unless she also came along.,1
4329,domesticviolence,She has a temper and some anger issues.,1
4330,domesticviolence,"I'm the only one that has seen that side of her, maybe I'm just the cause.",1
4331,domesticviolence,"To add to the story, she left me with scars on my arms a few months ago while I was trying to calm her down while giving her kisses.",1
4332,domesticviolence,She dug her nails into me pretty severely.,1
4333,domesticviolence,"I had pictures which the officers asked to see, which I showed them.",1
4334,domesticviolence,I’m looking for advice to try to help a relative.,1
4335,domesticviolence,She’s going through a very ugly divorce with her husband who’s trying to get sole custody of their three-year-old son.,1
4336,domesticviolence,He’s dating a woman with a substance abuse problem and a criminal record.,1
4337,domesticviolence,He met her three weeks ago and has been taking their son to sleep at her residence (unbeknownst to my relative till recently).,1
4338,domesticviolence,This Monday he told her he’s filing for divorce.,1
4339,domesticviolence,Essentially they had a few speakers which ran from people in the organization to the mayor and state representatives.,1
4340,domesticviolence,Then they had a short film about the director who was retiring and essentially how she transformed this small barely funded group into an amazingly helpful and essential part of the community.,1
4341,domesticviolence,It was without exaggeration insanely inspiring.,1
4342,domesticviolence,They then went on to have a slide show with pictures of some of the survivors.,1
4343,domesticviolence,Their pictures would appear as the individual told an abridged version of their story and how this organization helped them.,1
4344,domesticviolence,"when you first come face-to-face with a sociopath, you will be completely oblivious to who they truly are.",1
4345,domesticviolence,they will be whoever they think you want them to be.,1
4346,domesticviolence,they are fake.,1
4347,domesticviolence,"maybe it took him a while to show you his TRUE colors, maybe it was pretty close to the beginning.",1
4348,domesticviolence,but the most important time was when you connected at the start.,1
4349,domesticviolence,But Someone asked me if I needed a shirt and gave me one.,1
4350,domesticviolence,I asked to call my mom but she couldn't understand what I was saying so he told her.,1
4351,domesticviolence,The ambulance showed up and I told the cops that my boyfriend beat me but I wasn't giving any more information.,1
4352,domesticviolence,The ambulance lady told me that if I refused to go with her she would take me against my will because I was exhibiting signs of head trauma.,1
4353,domesticviolence,I went.,1
4354,domesticviolence,"Well, last time we fought, I did finally call.",1
4355,domesticviolence,"I was so fucking scared and while he hid in the basement with all the doors locked and light off, the cops took pictures of my hands and neck while I asked them over and over not to arrest him.",1
4356,domesticviolence,They told me it will be up to the judge when he sees the pictures.,1
4357,domesticviolence,"Well, what do you know, he got a warrant.",1
4358,domesticviolence,He didn't show up to the first court date so I know he's in even more trouble now.,1
4359,domesticviolence,"She angrily threw the blanket I wanted on my side of the bed and I told her that I didn't want to sleep in bed any more, so I was going to sleep on the couch.",1
4360,domesticviolence,"She knows that the doctors said not to do that, but she didn't seem to care, which to me is more evidence that she doesn't care that much about my health.",1
4361,domesticviolence,"As I was gathering up my things to leave the room, I got more heated and called her a bitch for caring less about me than the inanimate objects we own.",1
4362,domesticviolence,She got up and literally pushed me.,1
4363,domesticviolence,"I'm not very big, and while I pushed back for a while, she eventually pushed me out of the room and slammed the door.",1
4364,domesticviolence,"He grew from a short, stubby, orange haired, freckle faced, awkward boy into a seemingly strong, tattooed, pierced, tall, ginger, man I thought I always wanted.",1
4365,domesticviolence,"From the time I was 13, I thought he loved me.",1
4366,domesticviolence,"I didn't know why, but he told me often; on the phone, through letter.",1
4367,domesticviolence,I was the girl he thought he could never get.,1
4368,domesticviolence,I was out of his league (his words).,1
4369,domesticviolence,Going to chat to my therapist about it next session too.,1
4370,domesticviolence,"I need to find some sort of balance here, between living my life and keeping my fear in check.",1
4371,domesticviolence,God bless all of you who have been through DV and abuse - I truly wish you all the absolute best  in your lives and your recoveries.,1
4372,domesticviolence,We are all heroes here.,1
4373,domesticviolence,xx,1
4374,domesticviolence,"Regardless, that didn't last long, maybe half a year.",1
4375,domesticviolence,"I released that apartment, and most of my belongings (I kept a few boxes of my things from the military, personal effects, but little else).",1
4376,domesticviolence,"Looking back, there were some signs of emotional manipulation here, but it was subtle... and you know how it is, love is blind.",1
4377,domesticviolence,We got engaged.,1
4378,domesticviolence,It was quite the affair.,1
4379,domesticviolence,"Also, to answer the million dollar question everyone has, ""How does this happen to someone who outearns her abuser by a factor of 6?""",1
4380,domesticviolence,I wish people talked more about the other side of financial abuse.,1
4381,domesticviolence,"We hear all about the men who financially abuse their partners by prohibiting them from having a job, or denying them access to bank accounts, and that sort of thing.",1
4382,domesticviolence,There's also the side where they monitor every account and become completely terrifying if their higher earning partner so much as buys one cup of coffee that they didn't approve of.,1
4383,domesticviolence,They spend all her money on random crap that they can pass off as household expenses.,1
4384,domesticviolence,"If you withhold financial information from this type of abuser, they will get it out of you somehow.",1
4385,domesticviolence,Trust me.,1
4386,domesticviolence,It isn't pretty.,1
4387,domesticviolence,"I withheld my credit card numbers for a year, and I paid every day for it.",1
4388,domesticviolence,"Anyway, I'm totally ranting at this point, but it was seriously amazing to find one person in this entire world who actually confirmed that what I experienced in trying to access help was real.",1
4389,domesticviolence,My Daughter was recently in a domestic violence dispute.,1
4390,domesticviolence,The other party was arrested and there was a gun involved.,1
4391,domesticviolence,They are both under 21.,1
4392,domesticviolence,The sentencing will be soon and the court said he is getting probation and at the time of sentencing the no contact order will be lifted.,1
4393,domesticviolence,She has not attempted to move on and is waiting for the order to be lifted in order to reunite with him.,1
4394,domesticviolence,I offered to help but he declined.,1
4395,domesticviolence,After 6 months the debt hadn't moved.,1
4396,domesticviolence,"It was at that time I started asking him more about it, how it was going (I think I was pretty annoying TBH,) and he would say he paid off a large portion of it.",1
4397,domesticviolence,But he didn't and never followed through with the plan.,1
4398,domesticviolence,"i feel badly that I didn't just drop it, but I it felt like he was lying to me.",1
4399,domesticviolence,"he was my best friend since highschool, she was a girl i really liked.",1
4400,domesticviolence,"my parents let him live at my house when his parents kicked him out, and he started dating the girl that i really liked behind my back.",1
4401,domesticviolence,im not gonna go into too much detail about the drama but in short i kicked him out and they both hate me now.,1
4402,domesticviolence,there were some not so nice comments going back and forth.,1
4403,domesticviolence,"the other day they moved into an apartment together after being together for like 3 months, but i just found out through the same person who initially told me that they were dating, his ex gf [22F] that he has hit her on several occasions.",1
4404,domesticviolence,"We're currently looking for separate houses, haven't told the kids but my face is an absolute dogs dinner and will definitely have scarring for life.",1
4405,domesticviolence,"If it was the two of us, we could work it through but my relationship with G after so many telling offs, heart to hearts, explanations about his actions and their consequences, still goads me to get a rise.",1
4406,domesticviolence,"This is a woman who won't back down easily and will portray very intelligent coniving questions which have left me feeling dominated, under control and manipulated for a couple of years now.",1
4407,domesticviolence,The one guiding light for us to work through it is my younger two children and how much I adore them.,1
4408,domesticviolence,"Still,in this current situation, there's is a seemingly insurmountable wall of emotions from all parties which would need a huge amount of effort to even bring us to the negotiating table.",1
4409,domesticviolence,Hey y'all.,1
4410,domesticviolence,Throw away for obvious reasons.,1
4411,domesticviolence,I am so confused and I don't know what to do or who to reach out to.,1
4412,domesticviolence,I started dating my boyfriend two years ago when I moved away from my home to a new state for a job.,1
4413,domesticviolence,"He was funny, intelligent, and *very* charming.",1
4414,domesticviolence,I was silent and looking in his eyes.,1
4415,domesticviolence,"After about 2 minutes, I got off him and headed back to my room.",1
4416,domesticviolence,Just as I was getting to my door he yelled something nasty.,1
4417,domesticviolence,"I said something like ""Go to hell"", and got in my room and closed the door.",1
4418,domesticviolence,He rushed the door and I had to use my body to keep the door closed when he bashed into the door with his body twice.,1
4419,domesticviolence,"once I saw the light, saw that I didn’t even know myself anymore, I shut everything down.",1
4420,domesticviolence,"now, maybe it doesn’t seem like all sociopaths are this way.",1
4421,domesticviolence,but they are if you let them.,1
4422,domesticviolence,have the strength to say no.,1
4423,domesticviolence,have the strength to be YOU.,1
4424,domesticviolence,(I originally posted this somewhere else but it was taken down because someone felt it didn't belong there) I think I should start this by saying that I was originally born somewhere else and moved to my current home when I was really young.,1
4425,domesticviolence,"I don't really know anyone else in my family on either sides, other than my mom, dad, and my brother.",1
4426,domesticviolence,"I have never really been close to anyone in my entire life besides my grandparents on my mom's side, and my music teacher.",1
4427,domesticviolence,Except my grandparents died when I was 8 years old (both within the span of 5 months of each other) and my music teacher had to quit his job as he was struggling economically.,1
4428,domesticviolence,She desperately needs to see an oncologist or something about these tumors she's developed.,1
4429,domesticviolence,It's breaking my heart seeing her like this.,1
4430,domesticviolence,"Other family members, all of whom are in Canada agree that going back to Canada (we moved to Texas in 95) would be good but her excuse is that there's no jobs.",1
4431,domesticviolence,Also her not having a passport (it use to only be a green card required to travel across the border to Canada) is probably deterring that option.,1
4432,domesticviolence,Thank you Reddit.,1
4433,domesticviolence,Some details changed for anonymity.,1
4434,domesticviolence,"Also, let me know if there's a better place for me to post this.",1
4435,domesticviolence,My wife and I are trying to help a family member in an abuse situation.,1
4436,domesticviolence,"I'll call her Amanda and her ""boyfriend"" John.",1
4437,domesticviolence,Amanda and John live a few hours away.,1
4438,domesticviolence,"Yes, you should!",1
4439,domesticviolence,And we planned for that.,1
4440,domesticviolence,"Because the data is stored in an encrypted Google Firebase server, you can download the app again and use their same username and password to retrieve their plan.",1
4441,domesticviolence,"So if you go to Walmart to get a burner phone (or when we provide one, in some cases), you can install it on that device as well.",1
4442,domesticviolence,Here's the [iOS <url>,1
4443,domesticviolence,"Starting at 10:00 AM on Monday, January 8, 2018 at 10:00 EST the online counseling service will be doing an IAMA where they take questions from the /r/IAMA Reddit Community about their services.",1
4444,domesticviolence,"Here at /r/Domesticviolence, we do not support one company that does online therapy over another, but we thought you may have questions for them and here is your chance.",1
4445,domesticviolence,Some of the past IAMAs they have done are: * <url> * <url>,1
4446,domesticviolence,"He finally lets me inside and we begin to talk (he's drunk as always, our schedules differ by a couple of hours so whenever I would get home at 6 he was always drunk).",1
4447,domesticviolence,He is sat up against my counter calling me names and I smack his chest.,1
4448,domesticviolence,Worst mistake of my life.,1
4449,domesticviolence,I never should have hit him.,1
4450,domesticviolence,And I fully believe that what you dish out is what you get.,1
4451,domesticviolence,"When I grew up, my parents were always working and were never home, didn't express interest in spending time with their children.",1
4452,domesticviolence,I was alone all the time and it made me depressed.,1
4453,domesticviolence,I wasn't able to make many friends because my parents never drove me to see people.,1
4454,domesticviolence,I did parental duties for my siblings.,1
4455,domesticviolence,I made my sister meals when she was 7 years old losing weight because my parents never cooked for her.,1
4456,domesticviolence,A little background here.,1
4457,domesticviolence,The girlfriend[24f] of one of my husbands friends from high school made a detailed post on Instagram back in December describing the abusive relationships she was in with her boyfriend[24m].,1
4458,domesticviolence,"About 2 weeks later, the post was gone and suddenly all was well and she is posting sappy/happy posts with him.",1
4459,domesticviolence,"I sent her a private message on Facebook asking her if everything was okay and if there was anything I could do, letting her know I was genuinely worried.",1
4460,domesticviolence,The message was never opened and that profile was deactivated.,1
4461,domesticviolence,He said all those things.,1
4462,domesticviolence,I currently don’t have a passport.,1
4463,domesticviolence,He sent it away because the W something tax return needs to be filed.,1
4464,domesticviolence,Whatever that is.,1
4465,domesticviolence,I’m British.,1
4466,domesticviolence,"John often withholds her very necessary prescription drugs to get his way, which is super messed up.",1
4467,domesticviolence,Recently she had a small financial windfall and he became super nice and after they spent it all he reverted.,1
4468,domesticviolence,He's extremely manipulative and abusive.,1
4469,domesticviolence,She's shown us pictures of bruises.,1
4470,domesticviolence,"The plan right now is that she'll get her prescription sent to somewhere near us, then while John is at work, she leaves with her service dog, meets us in our car and we take her to our house a few hours away.",1
4471,domesticviolence,No I’m not.,1
4472,domesticviolence,What I am saying though is that man and woman were designed to have a mate.,1
4473,domesticviolence,A mate who completes you and makes you happy.,1
4474,domesticviolence,A mate you can love and be loved by.,1
4475,domesticviolence,"I never searched for a man to make me happy or be my knight in shining armour, but he found me anyway.",1
4476,domesticviolence,I'm having problems with a friend and I thought an outsider's perspective might be useful.,1
4477,domesticviolence,"She's always been a bit overly emotional and controlling, having previously been very easy to anger, and having previously tracked me and an ex through my phone, and going through my belongings without my knowledge to check texts etc.",1
4478,domesticviolence,It really worsened recently.,1
4479,domesticviolence,Maybe a year or so arguments because a regular occurrence when we had been drinking.,1
4480,domesticviolence,"I've had to deal with taking care of her after outbursts like this on numerous occasions, the worst being a visit to the hospital when she stormed off and I found her in a parking lot, having fallen and hit their head.",1
4481,domesticviolence,While he constantly texts and asks what I'm doing.,1
4482,domesticviolence,"If I don't satisfactorily respond, he gets passive aggressive and tells me he's worried about what I'm doing, he's ""bugging out"" his ears are ringing so he knows I'm doing something.",1
4483,domesticviolence,He said that today.,1
4484,domesticviolence,Via text when I was on the phone with driver control.,1
4485,domesticviolence,"It makes me think he is psychic or something, because any time I do anything to try and get past this relationship, for myself, it's like he knows.",1
4486,domesticviolence,Anything you forgot to write about in your statement that you wish you would've?,1
4487,domesticviolence,I have so much to say that I have no idea where to start.,1
4488,domesticviolence,Thank you so much in advance.,1
4489,domesticviolence,"sending hope, love, courage and so many prayers for everyone during this season of your lives.",1
4490,domesticviolence,so thankful for this community and support from each and every single one of you.,1
4491,domesticviolence,I told him what he did.,1
4492,domesticviolence,My brother realized the situation.,1
4493,domesticviolence,"Once my partner arrived back after 7 hours, he messaged me and said ""I didnt mean it to seem like a break up"".",1
4494,domesticviolence,"But, my brother was angry.",1
4495,domesticviolence,He kicked him out.,1
4496,domesticviolence,We still have up until December on this lease together.,1
4497,domesticviolence,I sponsor him in this country because he cannot stay on his own.,1
4498,domesticviolence,We also work together.,1
4499,domesticviolence,Today he was crying and begging me not to leave him (which I already had done) etc.,1
4500,domesticviolence,I told him he needs mental health care - not for the first time - and that I can't trust him after what happened on the stairs because he crossed an even worse line than he has before with verbal abuse.,1
4501,domesticviolence,"My sister is an alcoholic as well and also drinks too much, tho not as much as this fellow.",1
4502,domesticviolence,I've never been comfortable with the level of her drinking or her personal choices and I live long distance from her.,1
4503,domesticviolence,I try to nudge her in more positive directions and in the past 18 months have been offering a few hundred in financial support monthly to her to help her better provide for her kids.,1
4504,domesticviolence,"About 6 months ago, it came out that her boyfriend has been screaming in her face and laying his hands on her.",1
4505,domesticviolence,"Usually she beats him up as much or worse - I think it's pure insanity and I told her that she needed to make physical contact a 'red line' and if I heard about it, I would call the local police office and report him.",1
4506,domesticviolence,He abused his ex girlfriends as well.,1
4507,domesticviolence,"I left him last June, after he tried to kill me after being released from a one week sentence for DV.",1
4508,domesticviolence,"That incident landed me in the hospital, though it wasn't the worst incident of abuse.",1
4509,domesticviolence,"But that night, I had a wave of courage for two seconds and told the staff what really happened.",1
4510,domesticviolence,He was arrested and has been in jail ever since.,1
4511,domesticviolence,Today at work I took a customer's payment over the phone.,1
4512,domesticviolence,I was pulling up her account so there was a moment of silence between us.,1
4513,domesticviolence,"I could hear a man in the back yelling,""I'm gonna slap you"" I didn't tell her I had her page pulled up so I could keep listening, because I was convinced I heard incorrectly.",1
4514,domesticviolence,"""Bitch I'm gonna slap you"" a couple seconds of silence,""I don't give a fuck"" , a couple seconds of silence, ""I will fucking slap you"" finally I said ma'am.",1
4515,domesticviolence,It took her longer than it should have to respond to.,1
4516,domesticviolence,"He laid me down and went to take off his clothes, then I sprung up, ran to the bathroom, grabbed the key(only one we have), ran to the guest room and locked myself in there.",1
4517,domesticviolence,Finally safe.,1
4518,domesticviolence,"No pillow or comforter though, just a thin blanket and some clean laundry.",1
4519,domesticviolence,"No matter, I couldn't fall asleep anyways.",1
4520,domesticviolence,"Around 6am I crept outside, took a shower, gathered most of his stuff I could find and left him a note saying I took his key, and when I'd be back at 8pm he should be gone and anything that he leaves behind goes to the bin.",1
4521,domesticviolence,"* <url> * <url> Again, we arent promoting one company over another, but thought this was an opportunity for some of you that cant reach a therapist IRL to consider this method and ask some questions.",1
4522,domesticviolence,"I hope you all find it helpful and informative, and /u/iTherapy has the answers for you that you want.",1
4523,domesticviolence,Good luck!,1
4524,domesticviolence,I'm a long time lurker of r/relationships but my post was locked and asked  to post here- I have never made a post before so I apologize in advance!,1
4525,domesticviolence,Thank you in advance to anyone who reads.,1
4526,domesticviolence,"I'm extremely conflicted in whether I get back together with my boyfriend or not, Scott.",1
4527,domesticviolence,"We have been in a relationship for 3 years, living together for 1, but I moved out a few weeks ago into my own place.",1
4528,domesticviolence,"For the first couple of years, everything was great.",1
4529,domesticviolence,"I dont know what im trying to do by writing this, maybe just to vent, or get advice.. i dont really know.. but here we go.",1
4530,domesticviolence,I was in an abusive relationship for 6 years.,1
4531,domesticviolence,Everything was great at first.,1
4532,domesticviolence,"He was a bad boy, but i saw so much more than what he did.",1
4533,domesticviolence,I loved him with everything i had and i was ALWAYS there for him.,1
4534,domesticviolence,I knew she wasn't scamming as she was telling me this and it was definitely real when her membership card name matched her credit card (in case anyone things she was begging for pity).,1
4535,domesticviolence,"She told me the police only helped 2/7 times, because her husband and the police are in some sort of brotherhood so they won't do anything.",1
4536,domesticviolence,"As she was leaving she told me ""now I have to go back there again"" as she was sobbing.",1
4537,domesticviolence,I didnt know what to say or what I could do to help.,1
4538,domesticviolence,Everyone I've talked with as told me I should've gotten her phone number because looking her phone number up through our receipts and membership files is an invasion of privacy.,1
4539,domesticviolence,"She's talked about a restraining order, but I don't know what Amanda needs to do that or what's involved.",1
4540,domesticviolence,Amanda is planning on living with us for a month or so before finding a new job and apartment nearby.,1
4541,domesticviolence,"I think she should stay longer for safety's sake, but that's up to her.",1
4542,domesticviolence,Thanks for any input.,1
4543,domesticviolence,We just want to help her; I don't want to forget anything that should be obvious.,1
4544,domesticviolence,I have started working on a youtube series about coping with and healing PTSD using movement therapy to find flow (hooping is my outlet).,1
4545,domesticviolence,"I am super excited to share this with you beautiful, strong, wonderful survivors, so please share this with anyone else who you think could benefit from this series💕 Wishing you well!",1
4546,domesticviolence,"Until next time, may peace love and light always be with you!",1
4547,domesticviolence,"[Journal Entry: January 18, <url> Edit: formatting",1
4548,domesticviolence,Eventually crazyass went flat out nuts and kicked both me and it boy out.,1
4549,domesticviolence,We were now homeless.,1
4550,domesticviolence,And we started hanging out with a friend of mine who was also in that situation.,1
4551,domesticviolence,We'll call this guy Wolf.,1
4552,domesticviolence,Wolf had a thing for this girl named S. S was one of those types who cheated on her boyfriend constantly.,1
4553,domesticviolence,"She went through a very rough patch about a year ago and her mental health was clearly affected, she was living out of her car, she had left an abusive bf and then she had a crash in her car.",1
4554,domesticviolence,For some reason she decided to go to Romania for treatment.,1
4555,domesticviolence,I only heard from her sporadically.,1
4556,domesticviolence,"Once she called me and let slip that she had been raped as well as hit, drugged, something about a court case, and whay sounded to me like a lot of paranoia about mafia and government.",1
4557,domesticviolence,I put this down to ptsd from her abuse.,1
4558,domesticviolence,My sister told me yesterday that my dad violently abused her as a child.,1
4559,domesticviolence,She also said that my dad was about to punch me in me the face when I was 10 years old (and she was 14) and she rescued me.,1
4560,domesticviolence,"My mum, stood by and did nothing, for some reason.",1
4561,domesticviolence,I don't remember.,1
4562,domesticviolence,My sister was an angry kid and she said her experiences sent her into a depression for about ten years.,1
4563,domesticviolence,"I found the situation odd at first but because he was drunk, it was ordinary.",1
4564,domesticviolence,He was sitting in his truck nearby watching me.,1
4565,domesticviolence,Then later I heard something hit my rv hard and in fear of my life I rushed to call police.,1
4566,domesticviolence,He fled and police chased after him.,1
4567,domesticviolence,"Not to my surprise he talked them off and broke in again the next night but that time I was home, he broke the door down and threatened to kill me if I called the police again.",1
4568,domesticviolence,"Even if people experience mental health differently, this reeks of toxic character.",1
4569,domesticviolence,"He is convinced he needs to stick around, avoid change, see this through, that eventually she’ll “go back to how she was before” (whatever that means) and that he’ll keep trying to make it work.",1
4570,domesticviolence,"The typical “I can fix this” response that colours victims of abusive partners - and having been one, it is especially demoralizing to see him having to go through this for the sake of avoiding both change and a failed marriage.",1
4571,domesticviolence,"What can I do to help him, besides support him emotionally, and eventually have him realize for himself that this is not normal?",1
4572,domesticviolence,"tl;dr: my [25F] partner [30M] is being abused by his wife [28F], but is convinced to keep trying to make it work despite the situation detrimentally affecting his own mental health.",1
4573,domesticviolence,My dad did this twice to her.,1
4574,domesticviolence,"He began harassing my brothers employees, telling them crazy stories that my brother was selling drugs, or that he raped someone, stories with I know are not true.",1
4575,domesticviolence,"We began hearing stories through the rumor mill that my dad was seen drunk driving in town on several occasions, and getting drunk in public.",1
4576,domesticviolence,"My dad broke into the house of a friend in town, the wife was downstairs and husband upstairs.",1
4577,domesticviolence,She saw the look on my dads face when he barged through the front door (she said he looked crazy) and ran upstairs screaming.,1
4578,domesticviolence,It is why I started studying gender studies.,1
4579,domesticviolence,"My dads rage from my mum earning more then him, even though she gave him at least half whilst he had affaris and caused hell in our household and physically abused her.",1
4580,domesticviolence,I have been in counselling since being in year 5 in junior school (I think 9 years of age) because they were fighting all night and I hadn't slept and they sussed there was something wrong.,1
4581,domesticviolence,This continud until I was 19 and my dad left (which was dramatic in itself).,1
4582,domesticviolence,"Anyway, so i'm reading a book called Toxic Parents and it basically advisers people to confront their parents.",1
4583,domesticviolence,"I wanted to chalk it up to finances, but our finances weren’t nearly as bad as they had been, so I started thinking that maybe something else was going on.",1
4584,domesticviolence,"When I finally got the job that I’ve been working towards my entire life, and you got your settlement and the opportunity to do the things you had been talking about doing for your entire life, I began experiencing this odd feeling called “confidence.” Not just having confidence, but being confident.",1
4585,domesticviolence,"Our situation was finally improving, but our relationship continued to deteriorate.",1
4586,domesticviolence,You attempted to exert a level of control over me I had yet to experience (which is saying something).,1
4587,domesticviolence,"But this time, I resisted.",1
4588,domesticviolence,"Hi everyone, So I am in abusive relationship.",1
4589,domesticviolence,We live together.,1
4590,domesticviolence,He doesn't pay for anything but his alcohol and drugs and occasionally his gas.,1
4591,domesticviolence,When he's feeling generous he has been known to give me 10 dollars toward gas.,1
4592,domesticviolence,I have an answer for you.,1
4593,domesticviolence,it is because he made you a part of his game.,1
4594,domesticviolence,"see, sociopaths will do anything and everything to manipulate others to make themselves happy.",1
4595,domesticviolence,"to feel liked, loved.",1
4596,domesticviolence,"mostly, they feed off of other people.",1
4597,domesticviolence,... My husband is an injured veteran.,1
4598,domesticviolence,He was pretty seriously injured in Iraq and then again in Afghanistan (muscle tear and then a spinal injury.),1
4599,domesticviolence,"However, the injuries occurred before we met.",1
4600,domesticviolence,"When we met, dated, and eventually married, he was under the influence of Vicodin, OxyContin, and Percocet.",1
4601,domesticviolence,"Sunday (the 5th) she went outside to drink her margarita, and our 4 year old followed her (she'd been ignoring us all day).",1
4602,domesticviolence,I went to help my 5 year old when she called me into the bathroom.,1
4603,domesticviolence,"A few minutes later, I head up to check on them, and I'm attacked with the accusation that I've locked them out of the house, that i""m crazy, how could I do this?",1
4604,domesticviolence,Etc.,1
4605,domesticviolence,"The front door sticks, for what it's worth.",1
4606,domesticviolence,"I don’t live at home anymore, and I take care of myself.",1
4607,domesticviolence,"However, my father is the breadwinner and neither my brothers nor my mother think they can leave because they don’t think they’ll be able to support themselves.",1
4608,domesticviolence,"My brothers are still in school, high school and college, and live at home.",1
4609,domesticviolence,My mother has suffered abuse from the time she had me about 33 years ago until now.,1
4610,domesticviolence,"My father would hit her but when I turned 16, I finally had the courage to stand up to him and tell him he had to stop.",1
4611,domesticviolence,"I never searched for a man to make me happy or be my knight in shining armour, but he found me anyway.",1
4612,domesticviolence,And yes he did rescue me…mostly because I let him.,1
4613,domesticviolence,"And in case you ask yes I am happy – in life, in love and within myself.",1
4614,domesticviolence,"Maybe I was a victim once, but I’m not a victim anymore.",1
4615,domesticviolence,"I chose freedom and safety, and I hope any woman reading this is brave enough to find those things too <3",1
4616,domesticviolence,Several month back I began casually dating a woman who was previously abused physically and emotionally by her ex husband.,1
4617,domesticviolence,She and I have really hit it off and have begun to care quite a bit for one another.,1
4618,domesticviolence,"For obvious reasons, she is really afraid to get involved with me beyond casual dating, and we’ve taken a break for a while to let her sort out some of her emotional issues.",1
4619,domesticviolence,"We hope to reconnect after a while when she’s in a better place emotionally, and some of the logistics between us are better.",1
4620,domesticviolence,"I’ve tried to be as supportive and encouraging as possible to her, but I have never been in this situation before, so oftentimes I am not sure what to do or say.",1
4621,domesticviolence,"Quick summary... She kicked her husband out several months for physical, emotional and verbal abuse to her and the kids.",1
4622,domesticviolence,Things have been going somewhat civil ever since.,1
4623,domesticviolence,"He has been paying her child support unmandated by the court (not because he is a good guy, but he moved in with his parents, and they make him pay her).",1
4624,domesticviolence,Yesterday there was an incident involving an arguement in their driveway (in front of the 3 kids) which ended with him punching out the side window of her mini-van while her kids were inside it.,1
4625,domesticviolence,It took some time.,1
4626,domesticviolence,And took me running down the street with our 3 year old son in my arms with him chasing me for me to finally get away.,1
4627,domesticviolence,"Understand that what i have wrote here is literally just the tip of the iceberg.. i could write about it all, but i would need to write a book.",1
4628,domesticviolence,I dont think i would ever run out of things to write about.,1
4629,domesticviolence,I have seen 1 doctor since leaving him and he said i have PTSD... i dont like talking about it so i never went back.,1
4630,domesticviolence,they will see that someone else is willing to do all the work for them.,1
4631,domesticviolence,"once you try to lead the way, you’ll never stop because they will never take over for you.",1
4632,domesticviolence,they will watch you do more & more for them until you are living your life completely for them.,1
4633,domesticviolence,"once you live for them, you become just like them.",1
4634,domesticviolence,"you will be completely controlled by them, not feeling comfortable being yourself.",1
4635,domesticviolence,Yet I’ve already been through the worst and come out smarter and stronger.,1
4636,domesticviolence,I’m not so afraid that I’m just running and not fighting it anymore.,1
4637,domesticviolence,So WHAT exactly am I afraid of?,1
4638,domesticviolence,WHAT is the reason of this fear?,1
4639,domesticviolence,I mean what’s the worst that will happen and how can it be any worse than what he’s already put me through.,1
4640,domesticviolence,"I just wrote a 3 page statement, trying to include the entire bad history"" of our relationship.abuse.",1
4641,domesticviolence,Is there an pointers or tips you have for writing a statement that lets the judge know exactly what this jerk deserves?,1
4642,domesticviolence,A certain length?,1
4643,domesticviolence,"Do I only talk about what has happend AFTER the assault, because there hasn't really been much.",1
4644,domesticviolence,It's more about all the things leading up to it.,1
4645,domesticviolence,I blocked him on FB and then deactivated.,1
4646,domesticviolence,"One two punch, because my FB addiction is another obstacle in my life.",1
4647,domesticviolence,"I'm very proud of these decisions, but it also meant leaving my ""Thrive After Abuse"" group.",1
4648,domesticviolence,"So now here I am on Reddit, hoping to find another supportive community.",1
4649,domesticviolence,Best wishes to all.,1
4650,domesticviolence,"An app made sense for this, since so many people have a phone.",1
4651,domesticviolence,But sometimes a solution can raise more problems!,1
4652,domesticviolence,"If we had an app that says ""domestic violence escape plan,"" and if the abuser checks the user's phone, that's even worse than a paper form.",1
4653,domesticviolence,"So here's the solution we came up with: the app is ostensibly a ""quote of the day"" app, just like so many others.",1
4654,domesticviolence,"You open it up and it just looks like any other, with inspirational quotes (carefully chosen to be relevant without appearing relevant, by the way).",1
4655,domesticviolence,He won’t give her access to their bank accounts.,1
4656,domesticviolence,"He refused to let her learn to drive, told her she wasn’t capable, that she’d get into an accident and kill their daughters.",1
4657,domesticviolence,"He’s violent, and he tried to kill himself in front of her after abusing her and that’s when she left.",1
4658,domesticviolence,"He is lying and saying he’s gone to more therapy than he has (she asked his therapist if he was going, no he hasn’t been), and he still refuses to give her access to their bank accounts or give her money.",1
4659,domesticviolence,My friend has no options.,1
4660,domesticviolence,#NAME?,1
4661,domesticviolence,"I would comfort her as much as I was able, and once when I was home on break, I even confronted my brother about his behavior.",1
4662,domesticviolence,"I tried to be empathetic and not accusatory, and have a conversation about his feelings and encourage self-reflection.",1
4663,domesticviolence,I talked about how I suffered from depression in graduate school and compared my symptoms of increased irritability and desire to stay at home with his current behavior.,1
4664,domesticviolence,"He seemed receptive to the conversation instead of becoming defensive as he usually does, and ultimately I suggested he try counseling, as that helped me.",1
4665,domesticviolence,"He never pursued it, though.",1
4666,domesticviolence,"She claims that because she is a woman, nobody will believe me.",1
4667,domesticviolence,"I'm not exactly sure what she did to herself, but when the police came she claimed that I hit her and had a flushed cheek to show for it.",1
4668,domesticviolence,"Fortunately,  the police were able to put together what actually happened based on my blood trail.",1
4669,domesticviolence,Thank God I was sitting when she hit me and that the blood all around me proved it otherwise I would be in jail for something I didn't do.,1
4670,domesticviolence,Things have been escalating for a while and this is the second time she has been arrested in the past 3 months for assault.,1
4671,domesticviolence,"They can’t all be wrong or insane, can they?",1
4672,domesticviolence,Abusers spend so long abusing and being nice and abusing and being nice that you start to think that you play a role in the abuse and the only reason he/she is nice to you again is because of some demand you met.,1
4673,domesticviolence,And your will to live/be safe/feel secure will override any trauma you have been through.,1
4674,domesticviolence,"You will do anything to make them nice again, because that means you get to be safe/secure.",1
4675,domesticviolence,"It's not contingent upon you, but on them, but you forget this.",1
4676,domesticviolence,(One is 3 yrs old and the other 19) .,1
4677,domesticviolence,Now my dad would beat my mom but over the course of the years as I grew older he turned the violence onto me.,1
4678,domesticviolence,He would see that I defended my mom and since I called the police one time (I found him choking her onto the wall) he stopped hurting her and transitioned into beating me.,1
4679,domesticviolence,Now I know you guys may ask why did you continue to allow the abuse with you if you had stopped it with your mother before?,1
4680,domesticviolence,Well I have an answer  to that my mother loved my father very much and every time I tried contacting the police she would stop me and I have a lot of love towards my mother and would do anything for her... but anyways back to the present we no longer live with him anymore and we have cut all ties with him except for my brother.,1
4681,domesticviolence,Above all else he made me feel not that I owed him for such affections.,1
4682,domesticviolence,"He made me feel worth something, that I was important and beautiful.",1
4683,domesticviolence,He gave me back my soul and so very much more until I married him.,1
4684,domesticviolence,I know this story might not be what you want to read – I didn’t fight the good fight by myself.,1
4685,domesticviolence,"Nor did I find my self-worth by myself – well I did in a way, but my friend, my love and eventually my husband held my hand with every shaky step I took.",1
4686,domesticviolence,"I keep trying, hoping we can be what we were...that the man I fell in love with will return.",1
4687,domesticviolence,What’s happening here?,1
4688,domesticviolence,Why rage at your wife when she tries to be affectionate?,1
4689,domesticviolence,Is this just another control tactic?,1
4690,domesticviolence,He also stated that I had completely cut him out of my life (I have been spending time with women friends and taking classes).,1
4691,domesticviolence,I don't live in the country anymore.,1
4692,domesticviolence,She thinks no one will help her and has a hard time trusting people.,1
4693,domesticviolence,She doesn't want to go to a shelter.,1
4694,domesticviolence,I at least gave her the number for a bilingual support person from the ywca.,1
4695,domesticviolence,My mom also wants my dad to pay for my graduate school degree.,1
4696,domesticviolence,"Husband, I wanted to do this amicably.",1
4697,domesticviolence,We could have made it through this heartbreak to our mutual benefit.,1
4698,domesticviolence,I was willing to give you everything in exchange for your helping me furnish a tiny studio apartment.,1
4699,domesticviolence,The value of such furnishings pale in comparison to the value of the property I was going to let you keep in exchange for allowing me to break free smoothly.,1
4700,domesticviolence,I was going to let you keep my puppy.,1
4701,domesticviolence,He said you better get a job by Friday or the homeless shelter.,1
4702,domesticviolence,I'm thinking of going to stay at my cousins place who is supportive but it's a tad dirty but I'm considering just packing up my bag left clothes and going to stay with him.,1
4703,domesticviolence,He also has my car and I'm not gonna try to take it back because he paid for my head so he gets my car.,1
4704,domesticviolence,It's not worth much but still.,1
4705,domesticviolence,Thank you for reading and I'm open to suggestions thank you Agian and I'm glad I got to share this,1
4706,domesticviolence,He tells me he loves me with his smile and outstretched arms every day.,1
4707,domesticviolence,I need to be a good mom for him.,1
4708,domesticviolence,&#x200B; Thank you for reading.,1
4709,domesticviolence,I have been holding this in for so long and I guess I just wanted to be heard.,1
4710,domesticviolence,"He speeds up and tries to catch up to her, and continues to yell at her face.",1
4711,domesticviolence,The girl turns around in pushes him out of frustration and can tell it wasn't meant to hurt him or anything.,1
4712,domesticviolence,"The guy reciprocates by immediately pushing her multiple times, and they were NOT soft pushes, and seems like he was trying to push her to the ground.",1
4713,domesticviolence,"Couple pushes in, I was in shock, by the fact that you could really be in a relationship with someone that is abusive or that physically hurts you, or maybe it was that moment, she found out who he really was.",1
4714,domesticviolence,"She got up immediately and walked the opposite direction, walking back towards me, and I try not to look at her but she was just devastated I can tell.",1
4715,anxiety,It cleared up and I was okay but.,1
4716,anxiety,On Monday I was thinking about humans and how the brain works and it tripped me out I got worried that because I was thinking about how the brain works that I would lose sleep and I did.,1
4717,anxiety,That night was bad just like last time.,1
4718,anxiety,Also yesterday my sleep was bad I woke up like every hour of the night just like last time.,1
4719,anxiety,I got kind of scared like I did last time but this time I think that this is fake life which is absurd but I just think about it then get really scared then I think rationally then calm down.,1
4720,anxiety,Next week I’ll be flying for our family vacation.,1
4721,anxiety,"The flights won’t be very long (just MSY to LAS then LAX to MSY on the way home), but flying really triggers my anxiety.",1
4722,anxiety,"Mostly I just like having control over myself and my surroundings, so the idea of being in a metal tube 30,000 feet in the air is not ideal for me.",1
4723,anxiety,I also have a lot of fears about terrorist attacks/mass shootings (movie theaters and other crowded public places are also a problem for me).,1
4724,anxiety,I was wondering if anyone has any tips for flying anxiety/fear.,1
4725,anxiety,Everything sets me off and I'm almost having a panic attack.,1
4726,anxiety,I'm going to my dads soon and that also makes me anxious because I'm afraid that I'm not in the mental state to go there and I want to stay at my moms but he really isn't happy when I do that.,1
4727,anxiety,Anyway when she complains or is feeling bad I comfort her and I've never raised my voice at her even when frustrated.,1
4728,anxiety,"When she thinks I disagree with her she raises her voice, I have to talk about what she wants to in general right now because she gets impatient easily.",1
4729,anxiety,I feel like vomiting because she also has so many redeeming factors but I don't want to lose her as a friend.,1
4730,anxiety,"I’ve been taking 12.5 mgs zoloft for about 6 months (yeah, super small dose .. but it was taking the edge off, i think).",1
4731,anxiety,I decided to stop taking it for a few days to see if it was really helping.,1
4732,anxiety,"Now, about 40 hours since my last dose, I’m suddenly kind of shaky and also flushed (my cheeks are burning for no reason.",1
4733,anxiety,And THOSE side effects are about to freak me out - do you think it is from my missed dose?,1
4734,anxiety,Is it possible to have such a fast reaction?,1
4735,anxiety,These past couple of months have been the worst.,1
4736,anxiety,My anxiety has gotten so bad it’s effecting my sleep and relationship.,1
4737,anxiety,I’ve become so paranoid about my health as well.,1
4738,anxiety,I don’t feel like me anymore and I just feel scared all the time now over every little thing.,1
4739,anxiety,I don’t have money to see a therapist either...,1
4740,anxiety,The sensation lasted hours.,1
4741,anxiety,"It seemed like a circulation problem, and I panicked and of course ended up in the ER again.",1
4742,anxiety,This time a doctor came to see me immediately.,1
4743,anxiety,He wanted to talk about my anxiety.,1
4744,anxiety,"He said he could run some more tests, but he didn't think it would help.",1
4745,anxiety,"I really don’t know what to do about this, and I’m wondering if I’m even able to get over this fear.",1
4746,anxiety,"A traumatic experience compounded it in me as a kid, and I’ve been experiencing it for so long that it feels like second nature.",1
4747,anxiety,It’s lkkely so ingrained with me that therapy won’t do much good.,1
4748,anxiety,I need some help.,1
4749,anxiety,"If anyone can offer some, feel free.",1
4750,anxiety,Also the headaches.,1
4751,anxiety,LOADS of headaches all the time.,1
4752,anxiety,I’m so done.,1
4753,anxiety,I hate this almost as bad as my brain constantly telling me I’m a POS.,1
4754,anxiety,Anxiety is fun :),1
4755,anxiety,And it makes me more anxious which causes me to slip up *more*.,1
4756,anxiety,It's getting WORSE though.,1
4757,anxiety,"I thought I could hold it down, this has been an ongoing issue for about a year or so and it has never been this bad but lately it's getting to the point where I can't even talk to my own MOTHER without freaking out over this shit.",1
4758,anxiety,She came back in town from a very long half year vacation recently and I had to go to dinner with her because that's what you're obligated to do and I had to sit there and try and make small talk with my brother the whole damn night looking anxious as fuck...,1
4759,anxiety,I know they noticed.,1
4760,anxiety,"I didn't do anything during spring break, except maybe go to work.",1
4761,anxiety,"And even then, I missed a day because I just couldn't deal with the stress.",1
4762,anxiety,Most adults get excited to tell you they did absolutely nothing during their break.,1
4763,anxiety,And there was a time when I enjoyed taking a break too.,1
4764,anxiety,"But now it seems like every time I have a break or a day off from work, it makes the stress worse.",1
4765,anxiety,I'm worried I have a blood clot or something that gets aggravated when I wear them.,1
4766,anxiety,"I just want to be okay and to have a good time on this trip, but I've been so out of it, and I'm at my wit's end.",1
4767,anxiety,"Right now I'm lying down and I feel blood rushing all through my head, and bulging of blood vessels around my nose.",1
4768,anxiety,I'm extremely sleep deprived and woozy but I'm scared to go to sleep and am in pain.,1
4769,anxiety,I'm so scared.,1
4770,anxiety,"I know every time I have panic attacks to remind myself it's just in my head, but it sucks when little things just make you feel like shit!",1
4771,anxiety,Does anyone else get triggered by stupid things like this?,1
4772,anxiety,"I'm even just pissed at myself for now feeling mad at my mom, like don't you know not to tell someone with health anxiety that ""they don't look right""??",1
4773,anxiety,Ugh!,1
4774,anxiety,"In class, im always on edge, i cant focus on one thing for too long and i constantly scan my environment and I think they think im looking at them which im not.",1
4775,anxiety,this also made it more awkward to talk to them.,1
4776,anxiety,I been there for a month but im still very nervous around my peers and teachers.,1
4777,anxiety,"I know my teacher and the tutor there get nervous/uncomfortable around me, lately they haven't been talking to me much or coming up to me especially the tutor to ask if I need help  which they did before, my anxiety has gotten worse and I probably look more visibly uncomfortable than ever so that why they have barely asked if I needed help or said much to me ha!",1
4778,anxiety,yet  seem more at ease with other people.,1
4779,anxiety,I was consuming quite a lot of caffeine (up to 500mg per day) during the summer and I'm medicated with 18mg methylphenidate for ADHD.,1
4780,anxiety,"(I was rarely taking caffeine with methylphenidate together as there are a lot of side effects after doing that, one of them is anxiety and increased heart rate).",1
4781,anxiety,I don't take methylphenidate now because of the high bp and my chest pains.,1
4782,anxiety,I have an appointment to the cardiologyst but until then I'll have all my trial exams.,1
4783,anxiety,"I'm only 18 years old, is it really possible to have a chest angina at this age?",1
4784,anxiety,Hello guys.,1
4785,anxiety,This is my first post here.,1
4786,anxiety,"Ever since I can't fall asleep on a random night (few months ago) , I started getting anxiety at night and before heading to bed but everyday is different.",1
4787,anxiety,"Usually, when I get on bed n off the lights, my body started to heat up and i would sweat a little which makes me really uncomfortable.",1
4788,anxiety,My heart would pound fast to which makes me anxious.,1
4789,anxiety,I've never spoken to anyone about my anxiety but I'm pretty sure I have generalized anxiety disorder.,1
4790,anxiety,When I was young I used to be very bright and would take charge of projects and doing assignments.,1
4791,anxiety,As time went on I became lazier but still fairly on top of things.,1
4792,anxiety,When I went into college I suffered and things never clicked.,1
4793,anxiety,Doing even the most simple of tasks or assignments were just so difficult for me.,1
4794,anxiety,I get anxious because I am worried about bad things that I think may happen in my life.,1
4795,anxiety,"Im worried about losing my job, my girlfriend might leave me for someone more funny, with a better job, that is more self confident etc.",1
4796,anxiety,You think these things because you perceive yourself to have no value.,1
4797,anxiety,"I get so preoccupied with these worries and it constantly undermines my self esteem that it applies to other areas in your life, even everyday interactions, going to the store, these can be extremely stressful events.",1
4798,anxiety,You're so unconfident in yourself that you have a million thoughts a second and constantly second guess yourself.,1
4799,anxiety,There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who wanna get to the point this gets kinda lengthy.,1
4800,anxiety,"Hi, I'm 19 and this is my first time posting here and I'm hoping at least one person can relate.",1
4801,anxiety,"Before a few months ago I never had to deal with anxiety really, but out of nowhere it hit me like a truck.",1
4802,anxiety,"I guess what's been causing it is relationship issues, but mostly health anxiety.",1
4803,anxiety,"My first major mistake was googling symptoms I started having, not realizing that it was normal for anxiety to cause physical symptoms.",1
4804,anxiety,"I've tried getting new glasses, but that didn't help.",1
4805,anxiety,Blood work came back fine.,1
4806,anxiety,I have tried medication but only helped with anxiety not focusing issue.,1
4807,anxiety,Some days I just straight out can't focus.,1
4808,anxiety,"Luckily, when I'm on auto-pilot and distracted, I can get a lot done.",1
4809,anxiety,Im 13 years old and except for school i never go outside i usually spend the whole day on the computer just watching videos on youtube and stuff but at the end of the day i get depressed and feel like i'm wasting my life.,1
4810,anxiety,I have friends but i also have severe social anxiety and i always feel as if my friends are just putting up with me.,1
4811,anxiety,I feel depressed and lonely.,1
4812,anxiety,I never spend time with friends and when i do i feel as if they don't want to hang out with me as we never do anything pls reply if i'm not alone,1
4813,anxiety,My chest has a different feeling.,1
4814,anxiety,Before it would feel on fire and chaotic.,1
4815,anxiety,Now it feels just wrong.,1
4816,anxiety,Like I am in medical danger.,1
4817,anxiety,I am a 26 year old woman.,1
4818,anxiety,"Like the title says, I’m rapidly losing motivation.",1
4819,anxiety,"I recently switched collages to be closer to home, so I could be closer to family.",1
4820,anxiety,"And my depressive spirals are coming more often, mainly because of the lack of work I do.",1
4821,anxiety,I always end up doing things at the last damn minute.,1
4822,anxiety,"My freshman year I tried my best, almost.",1
4823,anxiety,Now I know everyone is going to maybe think it's from the suboxone but it or at least used to be one of the things that helped my anxiety.,1
4824,anxiety,If I admitted myself I am afraid they'd admit me and make me go cold turkey.,1
4825,anxiety,I am unemployed and looking for employment.,1
4826,anxiety,I live with my grandparents.,1
4827,anxiety,I'm a 28 year old male.,1
4828,anxiety,I have had the worst anxiety of my life recently.,1
4829,anxiety,"As a college student I am now falling behind in classes, forgetting about sorority events and not interacting with my friends.",1
4830,anxiety,I am slowly losing my mind.,1
4831,anxiety,My room is a mess and the only thing keeping me out of a mental hospital right now is literally my students where I student teach.,1
4832,anxiety,"I am exhausted of fighting to get out of bed everyday, shaking when I sit in class and just not talking to anyone.",1
4833,anxiety,Hi everyone I have GAD that gets much stronger/prevalent when I don't have enough sleep.,1
4834,anxiety,"Coincidentally, it also makes me unable to sleep sometimes, so kinda like a vicious circle.",1
4835,anxiety,"Normally, I don't really have that many problems with it but I just started a new fulltime job with a lot of responsibility and that triggered my insomnia and subsequently all the underlying fears.",1
4836,anxiety,My doctor prescribed Xanax as a when-needed last resort but since I was really scared of withdrawal/addiction after reading up on the drug (it's not called Xanax here but alprazolam) I only started taking 0.5mg at night after really breaking down.,1
4837,anxiety,I am so sleepy and want to sleep so bad but the second I lay down it gets worse.,1
4838,anxiety,My chest and stomach actually tighten up with anxiety and *all* I can do is think about Pippa.,1
4839,anxiety,"Now, what I did was irresponsible and I *should* feel bad about it.",1
4840,anxiety,But this level of anxiety about something that happened 6-7 years ago that I can't do anything about now is insane.,1
4841,anxiety,"I tried talking to my family about it, but they even disagree on the basic premise that Pippa was even neglected.",1
4842,anxiety,"It’s only happened 3/4 times recently but I’ve been putting off having sex and I’m constantly worried that my girlfriend doesn’t think I’m into her or that I’m losing interest, and so on.",1
4843,anxiety,I’ve only just mentioned to her that I might be struggling with some form of anxiety.,1
4844,anxiety,It’s a vicious circle at the moment.,1
4845,anxiety,It’s almost as if I can’t relax and if I have nothing to worry about I create something to worry about.,1
4846,anxiety,Worse than that develop the same anxiety disorder.,1
4847,anxiety,Again another reason to finish the relationship.,1
4848,anxiety,I really love her but cannot and WILL NOT embarrass her like I did at the wedding.,1
4849,anxiety,My plan is to go talk to a private physiatrist and see what they think.,1
4850,anxiety,"I don’t believe medication is the only answer but if it helps in conjunction with therapy, a healthy lifestyle and meditation then I will try it.",1
4851,anxiety,I've always connected my self worth with how well I do in school.,1
4852,anxiety,"Right now, I'm failing the last class I need to graduate.",1
4853,anxiety,The final exam is 2 semester worth of stuff that I never really understood.,1
4854,anxiety,This is my last chance to graduate.,1
4855,anxiety,If I don't pass I wont get into the grad school that conditionally accepted me.,1
4856,anxiety,"I am currently only using 5-htp once a week, i get no benefit when i use it daily.",1
4857,anxiety,I have also been working out which has inevitably eased my depression and made my anxiety more tolerable but its still obviously taking hold of my life.,1
4858,anxiety,"Well here i am at this present moment, I have been contemplating having a sit down with my parents and telling them about my depression (pretty sure they already know, they just don't want to adress it).",1
4859,anxiety,"It had been hard, my parents come home at 9:00 PM and don't want to be bothered with me.",1
4860,anxiety,they go straight to their rooms and the only time they are willing to talk is when they tell me to clean.,1
4861,anxiety,But recently I went on a car journey with my friends and 5 minutes before we got to the destination I started panicking because I thought I needed a wee and took a valium (completely embarrassed myself in-front of my friends).,1
4862,anxiety,once we got to the destination I was actually fine and didn't really need one that bad.,1
4863,anxiety,"Since then it keeps happening, like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking.",1
4864,anxiety,then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear.,1
4865,anxiety,I'm so annoyed at myself that this is starting to control my life.,1
4866,anxiety,I don't know who I'm meant to talk to but I can't breathe.,1
4867,anxiety,I can barely get out of bed or check my phone without panicking.,1
4868,anxiety,But I'm always checking my phone in case someone messages me.,1
4869,anxiety,I don't have it on loud because I don't like the noise.,1
4870,anxiety,"Yet my job requires me to always be reachable and the staff under me always ask me to help them, but I can't even help myself.",1
4871,anxiety,My problems started after my first panic attack which had happened in October.,1
4872,anxiety,"After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects.",1
4873,anxiety,"My bp with Zoloft was around 120/70 After some weeks the anxiety came back with horror, fear of the death and lump in a neck, stiffness in chest.",1
4874,anxiety,"My blood thyroid hormones were measured, everything's perfect.",1
4875,anxiety,I was freaking out.,1
4876,anxiety,"I stood on my back porch for about 30 minutes hyperventilating before I could convince myself that ""I am in control!""",1
4877,anxiety,I was embarrassing !,1
4878,anxiety,I couldn't believe that I allowed myself to get so worked up.,1
4879,anxiety,But it was not as embarrassing as It/ I would soon be.....,1
4880,anxiety,When I was living with people I would stand behind the door and wait for it to be quiet before I step out of my room.,1
4881,anxiety,It makes me so anxious to have to talk to people.,1
4882,anxiety,It didn’t help that one of them would play loud music all day so I would put in my headphones and go to sleep until he has stopped.,1
4883,anxiety,"I was so anxious and depressed that semester, it really affected my grades.",1
4884,anxiety,"Anyway, today was my first time seeing someone for help about my anxiety and I did not know what to expect at all.",1
4885,anxiety,"I'm afraid about what they may do next, what they might say to me next, what they might ask me next.",1
4886,anxiety,"I just want to be by myself, in my own place, with my computer, my keyboard, my guitar, and my bed.",1
4887,anxiety,"I'm a teen, so I don't really have that choice, but to be honest, nobody really does, no matter  how old they are.",1
4888,anxiety,You always have to be around people for one reason or another.,1
4889,anxiety,I'm just never comfortable around people anymore.,1
4890,anxiety,"For no reason, I'll just wake up with anxiety like feelings.",1
4891,anxiety,"Stomach ache, uneasiness, some sort of dread, or feeling like any little thing would bring me over the edge and have a panic attack.",1
4892,anxiety,I don't understand why and it can last for a long time.,1
4893,anxiety,"Sometimes the breathing exercises help take the edge off it, but it doesn't fully help.",1
4894,anxiety,I keep on getting crap from non work people about oh just fly.,1
4895,anxiety,I try to psyche myself up to do it but after the 5 minutes of feeling like “yeah I can do it” I feel beyond tense.,1
4896,anxiety,Anyone been in a similar spot?,1
4897,anxiety,What did you end up doing?,1
4898,anxiety,I’ve put my family through it too many times and it’s putting a strain on my relationship.,1
4899,anxiety,I’m not who I used to be.,1
4900,anxiety,And because of that I’m afraid people are going to leave me.,1
4901,anxiety,My partner especially.,1
4902,anxiety,He’s seen me go through this before and I’m afraid he’s going to give up on me.,1
4903,anxiety,Cut to yesterday... My parents booked me in for an emergency appointment with the DR because my anxiety and depression is so bad I cannot function day to day and spend most of my time stuck in bed panicking.,1
4904,anxiety,I was prescribed 2mg Valium to go alongside my anti-depressants.,1
4905,anxiety,I took one and within 15 minutes I went from SEVERE anxiety to COMPLETE calmness Well... here comes the paranoia associated with my bad cannabis trip years ago...,1
4906,anxiety,I FREAKED.,1
4907,anxiety,Bottom line is this is the first situation in a long while causing me to really get anxious.,1
4908,anxiety,I'm thinking about it most of the time and waffling about it.,1
4909,anxiety,And today I got the invitation and started looking into flights and transport and I'm overwhelmed.,1
4910,anxiety,"I'm at an age where traveling alone shouldn't be a big deal, but it is, I never have traveled alone aside from a handful of 2 hr bus trips in 2007ish.",1
4911,anxiety,Any advice?,1
4912,anxiety,I can't stop the ruminating thoughts about the whole process.,1
4913,anxiety,I also can't stop the what if's or I should have done more.,1
4914,anxiety,I keep blaming myself and beating myself up.,1
4915,anxiety,It sometimes makes me physically sick.,1
4916,anxiety,Do you have any tips to help alleviate the pain and stop the thoughts?,1
4917,anxiety,"They are very sweet and welcoming to me, but I feel so overwhelmed with everything.",1
4918,anxiety,"I feel as though I gave up my independence to come here, which is fine, but I'm having a really hard time adjusting to everything being handed to me when I've had to provide for myself for so long.",1
4919,anxiety,"I told my boyfriend that I need supplies for the week and he responded with ""ask my mom"".",1
4920,anxiety,I couldn't wrap my mind around that.,1
4921,anxiety,I still cant.,1
4922,anxiety,"so i finally got tired of being anxious and depressed, crying daily, not leaving the house a few months ago and decided it was time to see a doctor again.",1
4923,anxiety,"I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist.",1
4924,anxiety,He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed.,1
4925,anxiety,"I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day.",1
4926,anxiety,"With the switch to xanax ive gone back to my old ways of hiding away, crying, not eating, and have almsot purchased cigarettes again(quit smoking about 10 months ago).",1
4927,anxiety,"My main thing lately is that everything is making me feel overwhelmed and stressed out even in non-stressful situations, just every day life.",1
4928,anxiety,I have a good life that is a lot less stressful than most but it seems to cause me a lot more stress than it would to anyone else like my wife for example.,1
4929,anxiety,I feel like I'm always on the edge and my head is going to explode in angry/frustration over nothing at all.,1
4930,anxiety,"I've been checked out many times, full blood work and other tests and everything perfect with my health as far as my Dr is concerned.",1
4931,anxiety,I've always had an idea in my head that I would do anything and everything to avoid taking medications and I've been convinced that I can deal with this on my own and if I can't then I'm doing something wrong.,1
4932,anxiety,I feel like I am in a pit that I cannot escape from.,1
4933,anxiety,"I know that I am anxious all the time and terrified of fucking up and I know for sure that the more anxious I am, the more I cannot focus well and think straight and the more likely it is for me to fuck up .. and somehow, everytime I do, I feel like I just want to belittle myself so much that I deliberately and purposefully want to see myself covered in blood and bruises because I feel like I deserve it!",1

4960,anxiety,"I did some blood tests and everything is fine, so is this anxiety again?",1
4961,anxiety,When first diagnosed I was put on a daily prozac.,1
4962,anxiety,"3 years later, I've managed to wean myself off and just use my klonopin only for the worst attacks.",1

5034,anxiety,"Yes, it's 16 years old but the only other person to have the car before I did was my 85 year old grandmother who only drove it to either the grocery store or the thrift store, so I got it almost brand new.",1
5035,anxiety,But lately everything g has been going wrong.,1
5036,anxiety,"The gas gage doesn't work, the dash lights don't work, my tires need to be filled at least once every day, the brakes go out often, my battery won't start if it gets too cold, and now the transmission is starting to have issues.",1

5038,anxiety,I've been crying myself to sleep ever since I came back.,1
5039,anxiety,I'm scared something terrible will happen to them and I can't stop feeling guilty about cutting contact with them for the past several months.,1
5040,anxiety,My mind keeps replaying awful scenarios over and over again.,1
5041,anxiety,I can't stop thinking about these terrible thoughts.,1
5042,anxiety,I've been skipping my classes and haven't gone out with any of my friends because I'm afraid I'm going to get sick when I go out.,1
5043,anxiety,I'm supposed to go visit my boyfriend at his school tomorrow (I'm on spring break and he's not) and I'm already worrying about if I'm going to get sick and if I even want to go incase I start to feel nauseous and get a bad stomach ache while I'm there....,1
5044,anxiety,I'm wondering if anyone else deals with a lot of nausea from their anxiety and what they do to cope with it?,1
5045,anxiety,"I'm terrified of throwing up and so this is like the worst symptom I could ever have.... plus I always have this weird feeling in my chest/throat like something is coming up or is stuck and am belching a lot, like tiny burps.",1
5046,anxiety,"I feel like I'm crumbling and am starting to really slow down... My anxiety/depression has never gotten this bad before and I've just been a sad shell in my bed, can't even find the energy to turn on my TV and pay attention to anything.",1
5047,anxiety,Has anyone else who's dealt with anxiety their entire lives become very controlling in their relationships as a way to cope?,1
5048,anxiety,Speaking to my therapist I'm realizing that my method of coping with the intense anxiety I've faced in life was to become so organized that I thought I could control everything.,1
5049,anxiety,"But when situations arise, especially with those I'm in a relationship with where I can't control the situation, my anxiety goes out of control so I end up lashing out in negative ways.",1
5050,anxiety,If you have found you were controlling and were able to better yourself can you please direct me on where to turn to do the same?,1
5051,anxiety,I haven’t really complained.,1
5052,anxiety,Only once when my gram asked me to do a million and one things in a span of a few minutes (go get this go do that) when i was already trying to setup my moms new iPad so she could watch Netflix in the hospital.,1
5053,anxiety,That all said and done and I feel like shit.,1
5054,anxiety,Idk if it’s sick but it also feels a hellavua Lot like anxiety.,1
5055,anxiety,So i get my mom who’s in the apartment next door to ask her to lay with me for a few minutes.,1
5056,anxiety,"Can't put this under my true account, but I'm feeling horrible – I just completely screwed up a job application for a position I really wanted.",1
5057,anxiety,"Part of me is like ""oh well not meant to be"", but SERIOUSLY, the application was meticulous.",1
5058,anxiety,My email?,1
5059,anxiety,"Nope – my computer crashed, I restarted with a draft email which I (stupidly) assumed had saved in the correct way.",1
5060,anxiety,When people Don't understand and tell you how to be / when you evade all answers and feel like a monstrosity / Shut the blinds / the outside world / hide away / worry about the morning / upcoming day Night arrives / should be fine am I right / turns into a turbulent anxiety night / shake my head / am I the only one who feels this way / Take my meds / daily occurrence of will this ever end / hate this paranoia of internal mindset / Get told it will get better / how to be / change myself for you to try and frankly that's never the good answer,1
5061,anxiety,I am so scared to go up to 10mg because I want to still be able to lose weight.,1
5062,anxiety,My doc has suggested Prozac because it has had more success with weight loss than weight gain with majority of people.,1
5063,anxiety,I just don't know what I want to do.,1
5064,anxiety,I thought I was going to be able to get off meds but these physical symptoms which set off my hypocondria are coming back in full swing.,1

5074,anxiety,"I am losing so much sleep, even now when I’m writing this, I haven’t touched my phone in a few hours but my mind wouldn’t stop rambling, making me feel horrible.",1
5075,anxiety,It’s 1:33 am and I still can’t sleep.,1
5076,anxiety,"I feel like I have no personality or sense of self, and my mind will take sudden turns every week or so.",1
5077,anxiety,"I can get sudden obsessions for things and then drop them and lose interest instantly, because my whole set of core values, ideas and principles changes constantly.",1
5078,anxiety,And I've seen people saying that it's normal.,1
5079,anxiety,"I highly doubt it's normal to change so drastically and so quickly, because I have to accommodate to a new personality every single week, and it's disturbing.",1
5080,anxiety,"Actually, there were times when I changed from one day to the other and it's so disturbing because I didn't know what was happening to me...I just woke up feeling and being completely different, like something changed everything about me overnight.",1

5084,anxiety,"I've had several anxiety attacks in the last few weeks; twice, I was sent home from work about half an hour early.",1
5085,anxiety,Every minor detail feels just so overwhelming that I feel suffocated and panicky all the time.,1
5086,anxiety,"I imagine others here have gone through something similar, so I wanted to ask about your experience with grad school applications.",1
5087,anxiety,How did you survive?,1
5088,anxiety,"How did you preserve your mental health, and do the best that you could?",1
5089,anxiety,Thanks so much.,1
5090,anxiety,"I simply stayed home and did nothing, I was basically a shut-in hiding from the world.",1
5091,anxiety,"I had really awful anxiety at one point, I never went to the doctor for it, but there was a time when I got a panic attack and I had to call a friend, who helped me get through it.",1
5092,anxiety,"Then everything changed, I got an opportunity to work at a really tough (to be honest I would call the working conditions atrocious), minimum-wage job but I learned a lot of life lessons (and it changed my view on society).",1

5096,anxiety,"There was no reason to hate him, but I just felt this serious sense of envy toward him.",1
5097,anxiety,"He just magically knew what and how to talk to everyone, like the people that I wanted to talk to, but could never, he had already been there and done that.",1
5098,anxiety,"Now nothing is stopping me from doing what he has already done, but like, I feel like that entire pathway has just been blocked off, because of this envy.",1
5099,anxiety,I'm really not sure whether I should start to model myself over him or just remain like this.,1
5100,anxiety,"I feel alone, because I feel like people don't think ""I was having a panic attack"" as a legitimate excuse to miss something.",1
5101,anxiety,"I don't even feel like others with panic attacks 100% get it, because I don't really get that feeling of a heart attack or anything, I feel like my panic attacks are weird, and all the stuff I read about ways to help seem to be for people who get the heart attack feelings.",1
5102,anxiety,"I get a panic attack, and then get anxious about the panic attack, and it's just a big cycle.",1
5103,anxiety,"I try to open up to people, but they don't really understand.",1
5104,anxiety,I just want to be normal.,1
5105,anxiety,I take solo back packing trips and my friends really see me as someone fearless and free-spirited.,1

5115,anxiety,So my roommate recently moved out and our apartment is pretty empty and ever since she moved out i’ve had the worst anxiety attacks and have been kinda depending on my boyfriend and spending time with him to distract me but he works night and that’s when my anxiety is the absolute WORST.,1
5116,anxiety,everything flutters through my head.,1
5117,anxiety,like i think i’m annoying him by asking him to spend so much time with me??,1
5118,anxiety,(he’s never expressed this.,1
5119,anxiety,he’s actually expressed the complete opposite which is nice) but i feel like i’m being too clingy and too annoying leading me to want to spend some alone time in my apartment but my apartment just makes me more sad because i’m alone and i feel useless like no one care??,1
5120,anxiety,Hi Im a 19 year old kid dealing with Agoraphobia over the past year.,1
5121,anxiety,"Very boldly said, Agoraphobia is the fear of going to public places, sometimes to even leave the house.",1
5122,anxiety,"The past week, some very unpleasant things have happened in my household.",1
5123,anxiety,I told my parents about what I've been dealing with a while back.,1
5124,anxiety,There's nothing I can say or do that will alleviate her worries.,1
5125,anxiety,In the past I've tried to solve things but that doesn't help.,1
5126,anxiety,"I've tried just listening and agreeing or offering comments like ""that does sound bad"" or ""I understand"" but those don't seem to help either.",1
5127,anxiety,Does anyone have advice on what I can do or say to not cause anger or start a fight?,1
5128,anxiety,I'm at a loss as to what I need to do or be for her.,1
5129,anxiety,"I just stop doing productive things, talking to people, remembering appointments,  etc.",1
5130,anxiety,I am unemployed and almost broke but looking for work is causing me to feel like I can't swallow or get a full breath.,1
5131,anxiety,"I find that I have played video games all day, surfed Reddit or this morning I read reviews on a book that is coming out for almost 2 hours.",1
5132,anxiety,I am not on meds though I am trying Gaba since I had some anyway.,1
5133,anxiety,"To make it even more fun, my sister is mad at me because I am ""chronically self centered"" because I forgot to get back to her about possibly getting together for dinner, because I am shut down.",1
5134,anxiety,Wtf.,1
5135,anxiety,I did this to myself.,1
5136,anxiety,I knew I needed to study and I just kept putting it off and putting it off.,1
5137,anxiety,I knew I didn’t do well but I didn’t think I bombed it so fucking hard.,1
5138,anxiety,I’m going to have to lie to everyone about it.,1
5139,anxiety,I drove the 10 minutes home with my fiance on the phone helping me count my breathing.,1
5140,anxiety,I got home and collapsed.,1
5141,anxiety,I couldn't breathe.,1
5142,anxiety,My neck and chest hurt.,1
5143,anxiety,I was hysterical.,1
5144,anxiety,I don't know what to do right now.,1
5145,anxiety,I'm having so much anxiety and I feel that there is no hope for me right now.,1
5146,anxiety,It took a lot of effort to post this.,1
5147,anxiety,I panic very easily.,1
5148,anxiety,I also have trust issues.,1
5149,anxiety,"Help me out here, fellow anxious, if we gather maybe we could create an elaborate plan to help me avoid this, idk I have phone phobia.",1
5150,anxiety,These are really important conversations that I'll be calling to have and a lot depends on my explaining things and my demeanour and a lot of things could go so terribly wrong and I'm just so absolutely socially inept and phone calls are one of the worst ways for me to say words and make sense and - please help.,1
5151,anxiety,😔😔,1
5152,anxiety,"I suddenly became very weak, dizzy, and tired..spending days in bed.",1
5153,anxiety,"Never had a real fever..docs put it down to a post viral fatigue from something I had caught..I would get better for a few days then I would ""crash"" again.",1
5154,anxiety,It wasn't until I had had countless tests done that came back clean..and went to the ER one last time in desperation to figure out what was wrong that the doc sent me to the pysch as he suspected depression and anxiety (I had lost 10lbs by then..and didn't weigh much to begin with).,1
5155,anxiety,I was diagnosed with moderate-severe clinical depression and anxiety..the pysch ruled out CFS and lyme etc since my symptoms would come and go and kept changing by the day.,1
5156,anxiety,Was prescribed ssri meds..but this gave me the worst panic attack I have experienced in my life..aaand another ambulance ride..,1
5157,anxiety,(I suffer from Major Depression/Anxiety/Fibromyalgia and I wrote this as an example of what I feel on an average day so that people who don't have mental illness can understand) Hollowed out doesn't quite cover the feeling.,1
5158,anxiety,Because inside this shell are millions of raw nerve endings feeling everything that brushes by.,1
5159,anxiety,Everything is so raw.,1
5160,anxiety,Between the mental and physical pain it's incredibly hard to stay grounded.,1
5161,anxiety,Hello So I've had chronic social anxiety since I can remember.,1
5162,anxiety,"I had a pretty traumatic childhood, which has resulted in me being socially awkward, and very nervous in social setting.",1
5163,anxiety,Fast forward to this week- I've been invited to a party this weekend.,1
5164,anxiety,"I would love to go, but to be honest, I'm very scared to go.",1
5165,anxiety,"I've been feeling off the past day where I felt I was gonna get sick and just felt weird, I'm at my dads house visiting and have diarrhea now and my back hurts, I think it's from this bed.",1
5166,anxiety,And now I'm starting to tell myself maybe I'm having a heart attack.,1
5167,anxiety,"Maybe I felt chest pain a second ago, but can't tell if it was real or not??",1
5168,anxiety,Someone tell me I'm crazy and I'm ok,1
5169,anxiety,"I'm fat, unattractive, unmotivated, and best of all six figures in student loan debt  and not even graduated yet!",1
5170,anxiety,"I'll never be able to afford living on my own so there goes the last little bit of hope for dating, though relationships don't seem great to me anyway.",1
5171,anxiety,I've fucked up my future lol.,1
5172,anxiety,I have constant stomach pains and stiff pains everywhere from all the anxiety I feel on 24/7 basis.,1
5173,anxiety,"Also my health is declining as well, so that's fun.",1
5174,anxiety,Friends and loved ones (who don't have anxiety) keep telling me to relax and since it's such a busy place it's nothing personal and to not think it worry about it.,1
5175,anxiety,Which I'm sure is 100% true but not matter how many times it's said anxiety never believes it.,1
5176,anxiety,I start my next shift in 30 minutes and stating to freak out and have small panic attacks which haven't happened in a while.,1
5177,anxiety,"I've been so good about keeping my anxiety in control and not putting myself in anxious situations, and this job pushed that (being the public eye and fucking up is one my biggest triggers) but the pay and reputation of the company is widely known and it's one of the most wanted jobs in my town.",1
5178,anxiety,Does anyone have any advice or maybe gone thru something similar and came out on top?,1
5179,anxiety,I don’t know how it’s physically possible to be this anxious on this level of medication.,1
5180,anxiety,"To be fair my anxiety and racing thoughts about going back to the first employer are so bad that I can’t even really watch TV, so healthy coping mechanisms are pretty sparse.",1
5181,anxiety,I’m really only posting this because I seriously can’t believe that a) I can physiologically sustain this and b) that I still have been going to work every day.,1
5182,anxiety,"I guess I come home and break down every day too, so there’s that.",1
5183,anxiety,"I wish so bad I hadn’t done that, and it’s like my brain is living in this loop of both regret and fear, as well as rage at myself for thinking that would be the answer.",1
5184,anxiety,"I'm not exaggerating in that I legitimately, 100%, thought I was going to die.",1
5185,anxiety,I don't think I've ever been so scared.,1
5186,anxiety,I keep a diary and reading back on what I wrote at that time makes me cry at the memory.,1
5187,anxiety,Something else new I've been experiencing is numbness.,1
5188,anxiety,I've never felt numb before but it's been happening more lately.,1
5189,anxiety,"My heart races and my hands start to sweat, I immediately feel as if I need to pee and then worry as there’s no bathroom (on the train at least).",1
5190,anxiety,The unknown is the problem here – how long will I be trapped?,1
5191,anxiety,"I know this is stupid – I know I am fine, I know in all likelihood we will be moving again shortly, but it’s the constant what ifs that set me off.",1
5192,anxiety,"I look around and everyone else looks perfectly calm – perhaps mumbling at the inconvenience, but I am gripped with fear.",1
5193,anxiety,I hate it.,1
5194,anxiety,"I can get from feeling super bad (aka anxiety) to feeling super good with just one single thought (they're, most of the times, exaggerated).",1
5195,anxiety,"And then, with another thought I can get from feeling super good to feeling super bad.",1
5196,anxiety,"This is a matter of just seconds and these switchs can last for hours, stop and then come back again.",1
5197,anxiety,When I get the bad feelings it's just awful and the only way I can cope with them is thinking of a way of killing myself.,1
5198,anxiety,"Then, when I get the good ones, I completely forget about the sensation the bad ones gave me and I see the bright side.",1
5199,anxiety,It can take weeks until the problem is solved or I realise I was anxious over nothing.,1
5200,anxiety,Recently I'm moving home due to family circumstances and it's something I didn't want to really do yet but I am having to and the place I'm moving to is lovely but I'm really anxious over it and whether I'm doing the right thing.,1
5201,anxiety,These thoughts I'm having are causing this really dark awful feeling.,1
5202,anxiety,Is this feeling common?,1
5203,anxiety,I wondered if this feeling is my intuition but I don't believe it is I think it's purely anxiety.,1
5204,anxiety,Over the past couple of years I've been getting increasingly afraid of road trips.,1
5205,anxiety,I've been terrified of dying in car accidents.,1
5206,anxiety,I don't know entirely knowing where this fear is coming from.,1
5207,anxiety,I was in a super minor fender bender as a teenager but that was it.,1
5208,anxiety,"In college, I lived in a city with insane traffic and regular accidents but I never experienced an accident myself.",1
5209,anxiety,This isn’t so much a cry for help but I just want to rant about all my problems somewhere and this seems like the place.,1
5210,anxiety,I’ve had anxiety for a few years now but this year I’m full on depressed.,1
5211,anxiety,I’ve considered running away so many fucking time but I always feel bad for those I’m trying to leave.,1
5212,anxiety,I’ve never self harmed (thankfully) but I’m always bummed out and paranoid.,1
5213,anxiety,College is surprisingly the only thing that doesn’t make me anxious.,1
5214,anxiety,"I described my symptoms to friends and they would say its normal, or that they have thoughts of their own and that it's all in my head.",1
5215,anxiety,"But I knew this wasn't normal, I'm an optimistic person and I'm not afraid of people, I actually like socializing and meeting people, but my anxiety gets in the way and my fear of judgment.. but even I knew that I wasn't nervous, but my body was reacting in a way... idk how to describe it.",1
5216,anxiety,"I just wished that I could go for drinks with my girls and when guys came over, I wouldnt over analyze and get nervous... and start twitching because of all the rush of blood to my face...",1
5217,anxiety,"I dealt with this for years, and was going to just live like this... but then I went to a bar to meet up with my girlfriends but arrived late.",1
5218,anxiety,Once in the bar I saw a group of guys sitting with them.,1
5219,anxiety,"Now the past week, anxiety has hit harder than it's ever hit before.",1
5220,anxiety,"I'm checking snapchat scores, social media activitiy, last active etc which i know is already grounds for unhealthy relationships.",1
5221,anxiety,"The problem is when we were together, and whilst we were texting chat its absolutely perfect until the past week.",1
5222,anxiety,"The texts are shorter, my messages are being ignored (she's online but not reading my message) for hours on end, there's no good night / good morning message, it's all very limited and short.",1
5223,anxiety,"I've tried to challenge her on it as a means of settling my anxiety but this was met with a touch of hostility, in that 'yes everything is fine, i don't need to be in constant communication with you,' but I'm just so concerned that she's pulling away or losing interest and its all falling out of my hands.",1
5224,anxiety,I just can't do it.,1
5225,anxiety,"Some days I think: ""You know what, i'll do it!"".",1
5226,anxiety,But I never actually did it.,1
5227,anxiety,"There's a fucking huge wall, a Trump wall, stopping me.",1
5228,anxiety,"All I wanted was a job, now I got a job offer but the wall is stopping me.",1
5229,anxiety,"I also always bite and pick at my lips, meaning I usually have a patch of dried blood.",1
5230,anxiety,I also chew my nails (though I've found if I clip my nails almost everyday it goes away).,1
5231,anxiety,I know these behaviors are typical of OCD but I don't have other OCD symptoms so I think it's just my anxiety.,1
5232,anxiety,Any tips would be appreciated.,1
5233,anxiety,Or if you just want to share your habits go ahead.,1
5234,anxiety,I'm afraid of losing who I was.,1
5235,anxiety,"I went into the bathroom and looked into the mirror and for the first time in a year, I feel like I saw my own reflection.",1
5236,anxiety,"I know the battle isn't won, and I've got a long way to go, but something just snapped tonight.",1
5237,anxiety,I understand what you're all going through.,1
5238,anxiety,We're all in it together.,1
5239,anxiety,"It started off small, but it's getting larger and larger by the day to the point that I want to cry.",1
5240,anxiety,"All I want to do is sleep, but no matter how much I sleep, I'm still exhausted.",1
5241,anxiety,I sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep.,1
5242,anxiety,I fuck up my school life by sleeping so much.,1
5243,anxiety,Why am I still tired.,1
5244,anxiety,"I keep getting sudden, very short panic attacks.",1
5245,anxiety,Or anxiety attacks.,1
5246,anxiety,"I'm not sure if I feel fear, I don't even know what the feeling is because I forget everything short term afterwards.",1
5247,anxiety,They last a presumably short amount time and is the worst feeling imaginable to me.,1
5248,anxiety,"Some random thought I can never remember triggers it (it's definitely something that repeats though, it's a familiar feeling afterwards).",1
5249,anxiety,I was working on this so hard and spent all of my money... and I just failed my driving test.,1
5250,anxiety,Now the idea of retaking it gives me a panic attack.,1
5251,anxiety,"I started learning how to drive 4 years ago, and it was okay until I got this driving instructor.",1
5252,anxiety,"90% of the time when I should be learning, he would be lookig on his phone and he would never point out any problems so I felt rather confident to finally try and get my license.",1
5253,anxiety,In my country you first have to pass the test with your instructor and just then in an official institution.,1
5254,anxiety,"I can't afford a treadmill and I'm not a big fan of gyms (plus there's none really nearby), so I'm trying to use really the one option available: going outside.",1
5255,anxiety,This is a real problem for me and my anxiety.,1
5256,anxiety,"I feel like a gasping hippopotamus when I try running and am too embarrassed to let anyone see me like that, so every time I see a car or person, I stop running and immediately go back home.",1
5257,anxiety,"I try going outside late at night and early in the morning so I can run, but there are like always people around and it drives me insane.",1
5258,anxiety,"I don't know how to maintain the motivation to be active while dealing with my anxiety that keeps convincing me that everyone is judging me and may yell insults at me or the other side of things: may kidnap, attack or murder me (since I go out when it's pitch black outside to reduce the ability to see me).",1
5259,anxiety,Another time I had one was today in class.,1
5260,anxiety,I was worrying about fainting because I fainted last week and didn't want it to happen again.,1
5261,anxiety,"Today I was feeling dizzy from worrying and I was thinking ""I need to get out of here.""",1
5262,anxiety,I managed to calm myself down by taking deep breaths and closing my eyes before it got too bad.,1
5263,anxiety,Can someone tell me if these were actually panic attacks?,1
5264,anxiety,"People say ""follow your gut"" but I don't even know if I have a gut feeling on this anymore because I have obfuscated it so much and overthought it to exhaustion.",1
5265,anxiety,People have told me this is really no big deal in the long run but it feels absolutely monumental to me and will be something affecting me the rest of my life.,1
5266,anxiety,Can any of you relate?,1

5279,anxiety,"If it helps, I just started taking a new birth control that’s a bit stronger than what I was on before, so I’m relatively sure that’s why I feel bad RIGHT NOW.",1
5280,anxiety,"But it’s still bad enough that I can’t do much for myself, and I just don’t understand why they can’t believe that.",1
5281,anxiety,I think they must see me as a burden or something because it seems like they don’t think I’m worth helping if my problem stems from anxiety rather than a different(“real”) illness.,1
5282,anxiety,"and they’ve decided they are the judges of that, not me or my doctors.",1

5517,anxiety,The second step was to identify when my health anxiety episodes were taken place.,1
5518,anxiety,"Checking my records of doctor visits, I could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life.",1
5519,anxiety,The stressful period would cause some psychosomatic symptoms and would trigger my health anxiety.,1
5520,anxiety,Another trigger would be something I heard about someone dying or getting sick or reading about a rare illness.,1
5521,anxiety,I'm 29 and I've just committed to moving into a shared apartment in my city centre.,1
5522,anxiety,"I've never lived in a place like this before because it's an en-suite with my own double bedroom and bathroom, but the kitchen and lounge is shared with about 15 other 'profressionals' It's right in the centre of a bustling city near all the bars and music venues.",1
5523,anxiety,I've always lived in the suburbs but I've always felt a bit disconnected from everything because most of my (limited) social life takes place in the city centre.,1
5524,anxiety,But now I'm scared because I'm such an introvert and there's going to be lots of people around all the time and I'm worried I've made a mistake.,1
5525,anxiety,Another big worry of mine is that my ex best friend lives just a few streets away from where I will be living and we are going to be sharing the same supermarket etc.,1
5526,anxiety,Now I want to drink till I'm drunk again and my head sounds as though there is yelling when I'm the only one home.,1
5527,anxiety,Hmm...fun times.,1
5528,anxiety,At least I have a drs appointment coming up soon so I can bring it up.,1
5529,anxiety,Still.,1
5530,anxiety,These moments suck.,1
5531,anxiety,"I am not sad, I am not depressed, I am still a very happy and optimistic person with a great life, good friends, family, job, all that.",1
5532,anxiety,But I am struggling to manage this anxiety because it spills into life.,1
5533,anxiety,"I don't have thoughts I obsess over, I don't worry about anything really.",1
5534,anxiety,It's just the stress I have been through set up my body for this crap response.,1
5535,anxiety,"Besides relaxation, meditation and such, what can you recommend?",1
5536,anxiety,I just feel so naked and unprotected.,1
5537,anxiety,WIll this be any different with the therapist?,1
5538,anxiety,"After all I don't even know if I want to go to this therapy session, I'm so confused about myself it's unbelievable.",1
5539,anxiety,Has anyone of you guys ever experienced this self-confusion before and can help me finding myself again?,1
5540,anxiety,"The appointment has not even yet been made and I'm already freakin' out about it, I feel kinda like an idiot right now.",1
5541,anxiety,I constantly face so much anxiety in school.,1
5542,anxiety,"It makes me extremely depressed, and it’s just hard to cope with.",1
5543,anxiety,"I don’t know if anxiety/depression have anything to do with memory performance, but I’ve noticed that I remember a lot less compared to when I wasn’t in a depressed and anxious state.",1
5544,anxiety,For hours on end I contemplate and procrastinate everyday about my depressing life.,1
5545,anxiety,It’s just sad.,1
5546,anxiety,"Every once and a while I will get this over whelming feeling in my head where I feel really out of it, and freaked out.",1
5547,anxiety,"I will feel like I haven’t slept in a bit, I don’t feel like me.",1
5548,anxiety,I’m anxious but also tired and I wanna just go take a nap.,1
5549,anxiety,But my inner self tells me that I am going to have a seizure.,1
5550,anxiety,I don’t have seizures or anything and I am completely healthy.,1
5551,anxiety,Fuck you for getting money through your job while doing literally nothing to help your patients.,1
5552,anxiety,Fuck you for being an absolutely useless bigot.,1
5553,anxiety,"This town is small and i will suggest everyone I know to never, ever go to your damn fucking clinic you dick.",1
5554,anxiety,&#x200B; Time to get a new doctor and see if I can finally get someone to listen.,1
5555,anxiety,His price is even higher than what I was told and he said that's after a discount.,1
5556,anxiety,"I'm a college student and apart from tuition I have food and other things to fund and I thought that by paying this much I'd at least get my money's worth in therapy, but other than telling him about my anxiety and family, and having him tell me I probably have OCD and Anxiety disorder, all I seem to hear is the rates of the therapies and how it would take over a year of dynamic therapy, preferably 2 times a week, at 80$ a session, and that I should be able to commit if I want to continue.",1
5557,anxiety,"The second session he continued with this spending nearly 30 minutes saying I have 3 options, seeing a psychiatrist and taking pills, going to CBT to treat 'only the symptoms' or seeing a dynamic therapist like him for sessions which would take a year at least to see results.",1
5558,anxiety,"What's more, the second the clock ticks 50 minutes he says have a nice day and sort of kicks me out.",1
5559,anxiety,So I'm supposed to believe this person talking about money on time I pay him money to talk to me about my greatest fears is gonna help me?,1
5560,anxiety,I'm having a rough time right now and going through some things where my anxiety and depression keep dragging me down.,1
5561,anxiety,My roommates have not really experienced someone with anxiety before really.,1
5562,anxiety,At least not someone who gets attacks.,1
5563,anxiety,"During the recovery of one of my episodes, I came up with this writing in the notes of my iPhone.",1
5564,anxiety,So here it is.,1
5565,anxiety,I've been trying to remain hopeful that these symptoms won't really start improving until 6-8 weeks like the first time I took it to relieve depression.,1
5566,anxiety,"It doesn't help that after looking up SSRI withdrawal online, I've read reinstating might not work the longer I'm off it and it's recommended to take a very low dose in order to alleviate symptoms.",1
5567,anxiety,This is leaving me worried since I've stopped for a month and took a higher dosage than I last left off.,1
5568,anxiety,"It doesn't say what happens if I happen to take a high dosage, so I'm worried I'm making things worse by continuing with this high dosage and I have no idea what to do right now.",1
5569,anxiety,I feel very messed up and I'm scared these withdrawal symptoms will never go away or may become permanent.,1
5570,anxiety,But the days leading up to the test were the worst.,1
5571,anxiety,I couldn't sleep 2 nights in a row and had to call in sick to work.,1
5572,anxiety,I had a near panic attack and was unable to eat much as i felt like throwing up.,1
5573,anxiety,Before the test my hands were shaking and my heart was racing.,1
5574,anxiety,I was really not in a state to drive.,1
5575,anxiety,Sorry for the super long post but I don't want to tell my mom all this and most of my friends don't know I feel like this almost all the time.,1
5576,anxiety,"I take my medicine for social anxiety every morning and I go to counseling every few weeks, but I've been to a counselor four or five different times over the years and I'm still the same.",1
5577,anxiety,I think I might be stuck like this.,1
5578,anxiety,"I honestly doubt anyone read this far but if you did, hello!",1
5579,anxiety,"TL;DR freshman year of high school, I'm super anxious about pretty much everything especially PE and disappointing my family by not coming out on top",1
5580,anxiety,For a while now I honestly feel like my brain just broke.,1
5581,anxiety,I am so embarrassed.,1
5582,anxiety,"I used to be really quick at replying to stuff, really good at video games (I would play competitively!!",1
5583,anxiety,"), The world was easy to navigate... Now it feels like someone beat me with a rock in the head and I never recovered from the concussion.",1
5584,anxiety,Everything seems so... Fast.,1
5585,anxiety,"In my mind I am in control of this, I don’t feel I ‘have’ to try.",1
5586,anxiety,I can get away.,1
5587,anxiety,It’s like I’m using drugs to escape but I’m not on drugs I’m just dissociating to a place I want to be.,1
5588,anxiety,I feel that if I was forced to be in reality I’d be just as angry and terrified as a drug addict in rehab.,1
5589,anxiety,I don’t know what to do.,1
5590,anxiety,It's horrible.,1
5591,anxiety,"The thing is, my urologist told me that it was just an overactive bladder and gave me some medicine, but it just worked a couple of days when I was ""totally positive"" about the medicine.",1
5592,anxiety,"Even, after taking the pills I felt great, like in a normal state, but the symptoms are here again.",1
5593,anxiety,Is it possible that the cause could be my sometimes uncontrollable anxiety?,1
5594,anxiety,Have someone had the same problem?,1
5595,anxiety,I especially appreciate stories of similar experiences and such.,1
5596,anxiety,I hope everyone's have a nice day.,1
5597,anxiety,TL;DR: I ended up with anxiety due to relationship and health anxiety and now I can't stop thinking about how I might some terminal illness (cancer) just because I feel some weird tingling or pain in an area I didn't before.,1
5598,anxiety,Or even a cough can freak me out a little.,1
5599,anxiety,If you also/used to suffer from this how do/did you deal with it?,1
5600,anxiety,"People who've been my ""friends"" for a decade stopped talking to me or inviting me to anything after my break-up.",1

5605,anxiety,My therapist told me to do some free writes about my anxiety and OCD thoughts (being afraid of panic attacks and fear I will act on violent thoughts) and in the book Imp Of The Mind the author talks about writing out thoughts.,1
5606,anxiety,I just don't know how to set it up.,1
5607,anxiety,Do you write as if the thought came true?,1
5608,anxiety,Do you just write the thought is there and why it isn't true?,1
5609,anxiety,Anyone do anything like this?,1

5616,anxiety,"From the moment we arrived at out rented apartment, she would just do nothing but complain about me, saying that I'm so ""over dramatic"" and that ""I'm just anxious for attention"".......I mean really?",1
5617,anxiety,"I never wanted to be like this, and she has the way of making me feel like I'm a bad and worthless person.",1

5635,anxiety,the most terrifying one is feeling like the world is expanding infinitely but also crushingly contracting in on itself.,1

5650,anxiety,"Now not all notifications scare me, like here, I won't really be too concerned.",1
5651,anxiety,I think the root of the problem is the sheer anonymity of when it alerts you a notification.,1
5652,anxiety,I have been thinking about it and I think that all anxiety seems to boil down to either fear of what other people think of you or fear of death.,1
5653,anxiety,I am curious if this is just me?,1

5759,anxiety,"My spouse and I live in a war-torn country full of people trying to rip you off any chance they get, everyone is rude and generally don't fit the way I've been brought up, everything is expensive and the stress is beyond measure here.",1
5760,anxiety,Not how we were brought up.,1
5761,anxiety,We're waiting for me and her to finish college so we can get out of here and move to a civilized nation elsewhere.,1
5762,anxiety,"It sorta works, but I don't like the feeling of being deadheaded.",1
5763,anxiety,I also don't have a good relationships with doctors considering I was misdiagnosed with bipolar as a teen and given lithium... Had a terrible reaction to it.,1
5764,anxiety,What are some more natural remedies or self-help you all do to keep yourself in the proper mindset to calm your triggers?,1
5765,anxiety,"I've started meditation and taking CBD oil (which work great, but kinda expensive), but it doesn't seem to be enough.",1
5766,anxiety,I just want to start living and be able to enjoy life.,1
5767,anxiety,"Deep breathing, reminding myself that I'm just irrationally panicking, promising myself to take it step by step, analyzing the emotional baggage I've placed on this paper.",1
5768,anxiety,"For weeks now, it's been sitting on my computer, mocking me.",1
5769,anxiety,"It's late, and I'm slowly loosing motivation to even try.",1
5770,anxiety,Can anyone help?,1
5771,anxiety,I really want to try and edit the paper into something worth reading without feeling like I can't breathe.,1
5772,anxiety,So I have been suffering from chronic anxiety for eight years.The kind where you feel some enemy is breathing down on your neck always.I don't want to get into the details of this matter because it's is very personal.,1
5773,anxiety,But from the beginning of this anxiety my breathing got messed up.,1
5774,anxiety,Like I was alternating my breathing between hyperventilation and shallow breathing through out the day for all these years.,1
5775,anxiety,"During these last five years I have suffered bone TB, now stomach gastritis for three years,also found out I have recurring kidney stones in my left kidney.Before all this begun I was relatively healthy without any complicated disease like  bone tb or stomach gastritis.",1
5776,anxiety,So it seems to me this long chronic anxiety and the resulting hyperventilation and shallow breathing and high blood pressure did make my immune system rather weak or damaged.,1
5777,anxiety,And I'll get an intense feeling of impending doom.,1
5778,anxiety,It lasts for less than a minute and then I'll fall back asleep.,1
5779,anxiety,It usually happens during naps.,1
5780,anxiety,I thought it was a seizure when it first happened.,1
5781,anxiety,Has this happened to anyone else?,1
5782,anxiety,Etc etc etc.,1
5783,anxiety,"My brain takes this one little choice -should I go back in the water- and blows it up so big that I spend 20 minutes trying to figure out what I should do, and I end up frozen unable to make ANY decision.",1
5784,anxiety,Does this happen to anyone else?,1
5785,anxiety,How do you deal with this?,1
5786,anxiety,So I’ve been taking 40mg paroxetine for around 3 months (I don’t go to her straight away) and have been fine until the past two weeks.,1
5787,anxiety,I’m beginning to notice that my anxiety is again incredibly high a lot of the time.,1
5788,anxiety,By listening to my body I’ve come to realise that caffeine is triggering me.,1
5789,anxiety,NOW this is new.,1
5790,anxiety,"I’ve been drinking coffee since I was around 17 (22 now) and I’ve never had an issue (infact, it used to put me to sleep) but now whenever I have a coffee (French press at home or latte from a barista) within about 30 minutes I begin to shake and uncontrollably sweat.",1
5791,anxiety,I don't know whether to call the crisis team see if theyll stay on the phone as i leave to distract myself.,1
5792,anxiety,Im determind not to be as agoraphobic as i was i will not be stuck inside trapped by myself.,1
5793,anxiety,Yet here i am frozen in bed scared to leave in case it means i even start getting ready to go towards to front door.,1
5794,anxiety,"I know i should eat, but the anxiety part of me keeps trying to convince me i dont need to eat i'll be ok if i just stay inside safe.",1
5795,anxiety,"I dont know what to do to be liked again, i guess it would be different if she had hated me from the beginning but that just isnt the case.",1
5796,anxiety,She also hates my boyfriend and doesnt allow him anywhere near her house.,1
5797,anxiety,"I cant move because the rent is only $500 and I cant afford anything else, and yes, I do have a job.",1
5798,anxiety,"I've even asked her why she thinks I'm so stupid and she said ""because nobody taught you these things"" so I guess shes helping, it's just hard to know that I'm a failure.",1
5799,anxiety,"I try to meditate and to think very very very deep before I say anything, like to try and think of every outcome and if it might make her hate me more then I shouldnt say it.",1
5800,anxiety,For the past couple months I have had really bad soreness and tightness in my upper back and neck.,1
5801,anxiety,Sometimes it gets so stiff I can barely move my head.,1
5802,anxiety,At first i thought it was a physical injury so I went to the doctors and had an xray but they could not find anything.,1
5803,anxiety,I notice it flares up when im anxious.,1
5804,anxiety,"I have tried many self massages, creams, baths, pads, you name it.",1
5805,anxiety,Anxiety kicked in but then heightened by all the fucking coffee I drank from working before the meet.,1
5806,anxiety,"I started shaking, I couldn't lift my head up.",1
5807,anxiety,"My girlfriend and I stepped out for a smoke, and I told her the situation, the guys moved away... they were hot too so thanks to my anxiety I missed out yet again on another golden opportunity.",1
5808,anxiety,"But once we got back to our seats, I told my girl that I recently got close to that I had anxiety and the symptoms, just casually because at this point its just a thing I have to tell people, but this time it wasn't to a fellow artist or designer, she was a nurse.",1
5809,anxiety,"Instead of saying yeah I have it to or yeah we all get like that, she asked me further questions.",1
5810,anxiety,I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep.,1
5811,anxiety,I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didnʻt want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldnʻt want to compare my stress to that.,1
5812,anxiety,"Just wondering if itʻs possible that this is like mild ""anxiety"" or I am just sleep deprived?",1
5813,anxiety,Also if its possible that anxiety can be come back after a decade of not having any noticeable events?,1
5814,anxiety,Thanks ahead of time for any help.,1
5815,anxiety,These thoughts are always a great source of frustration to me especially when I’m close to an artistic deadline like a gallery exposition that is coming soon.,1
5816,anxiety,I’m never confident enough to show what I do.,1
5817,anxiety,Even the minister of culture in my country has made some very positive criticisms about it but my mind always goes back to thinking those people are only saying these things to be nice.,1
5818,anxiety,"Honestly, does anyone else feel that way?",1
5819,anxiety,What do you do when this happens?,1
5820,anxiety,I desperately need a car and found a great opportunity but the previous owner died of a heart attack in it.,1
5821,anxiety,"Thats my number one cause of anxiety, the fear of heart attacks.",1
5822,anxiety,He was relatively healthy and young.,1
5823,anxiety,I feel like a big idiot for not taking it.,1
5824,anxiety,But I have vivid nightmares of me having heart attacks then I wake up with a panic attack that lasts hours.,1
5825,anxiety,I've been trying to avoid social media because I know how anxiety provoking it can be for me.,1
5826,anxiety,I joined it ultimately because I thought it would make me feel more connected to people.,1
5827,anxiety,"It kind of does, which I'm okay with.",1
5828,anxiety,"But of course, now I'm looking at everyone's highlight reels and friend count (which I'm especially envious of) and I can't help but feel like crap.",1
5829,anxiety,"My social life came to a standstill in my early 20s when I compartmentalized all facets of my life, ensuring the people I knew never intermingled.",1
5830,anxiety,"This has been affecting me for two weeks now, off and on.",1
5831,anxiety,It's a combination of terrifying and annoying.,1
5832,anxiety,"Randomly throughout the day, I will notice that it feels harder to breathe and I take deeper breaths than normal.",1
5833,anxiety,"Air coming in almost feels like it has viscosity to it, like molasses, which makes me cough.",1
5834,anxiety,"Most of the time, I don't cough up anything so it's dry.",1
5835,anxiety,"This even negatively impacts me more because it causes me relationship anxiety, every time I have a freak out about travelling I start getting intrusive thoughts like ""what if I get there and realize I don't love him or I'm not attracted to him"" or when he sends me a text that makes me happy my anxiety creeps in saying that I'm secretly forcing any positive feelings I have for him.",1
5836,anxiety,I know these are linked to my travel anxiety because they only pop up AFTER I've had a moment of freaking out thinking about the travel.,1
5837,anxiety,"Whenever we Skype, just talking to him feels like home, and talking about the upcoming trip feels just exciting, not nerve-wracking.",1
5838,anxiety,"This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it.",1
5839,anxiety,"I need to figure out how to calm all this anticipatory anxiety so I can just let myself enjoy my relationship, the excitement leading up to our trip, and even the trip itself (although I feel like once I'm there I'll be fine)!",1
5840,anxiety,I just told them I had too much anxiety and breaking up with my boyfriend made me really depressed.,1
5841,anxiety,"And that I didn't know what I'm going to do, maybe I'll find a job.",1
5842,anxiety,So now I just stay home and go on my computer all day.,1
5843,anxiety,I leave the house maybe twice a week.,1
5844,anxiety,I have constant feelings about being useless and that I'd be better off dead.,1
5845,anxiety,"So earlier today I was suffering from extreme derealization, depression, and anxiety.",1
5846,anxiety,So what I did is I let the thoughts free and whenever I got a tnhoguht I ignored it and I think I just suppressed my anxiety deep down.,1
5847,anxiety,Now instead of having a panic attack I'm having body symptoms of it.,1
5848,anxiety,I can't think myself form the symptoms.,1
5849,anxiety,I can't find the trigger it just happened.,1
5850,anxiety,I can't begin to summarise how I feel about her.,1
5851,anxiety,"I want to spend the rest of my life with this person, but I want to help work through this stuff together.",1
5852,anxiety,Once she goes into an anxiety spiral I'm completely at a loss of what to do apart from hold her and stroke her hair.,1
5853,anxiety,"What strategies can help break the spiral when she starts one, and how can I approach the topic of seeing a counsellor and developing mindfulness strategies without her going into a panic attack?",1
5854,anxiety,"Help me /r/anxiety, you're my only hope.",1
5855,anxiety,"I can't tell if that's me being a toxic person or not, and I feel guilty for feeling relieved.",1
5856,anxiety,"We were such good friends once, but I have to admit we hadn't talked about art or writing (the things that made us friends) for years.",1
5857,anxiety,"My anxiety has muddied the waters, and maybe all my shit and all my emotional abuse crap did ruin everything and it was all my fault.",1
5858,anxiety,Maybe I did end things because I'd felt blamed for 2 months straight and just wanted to get away from the anxiety it was all causing me.,1
5859,anxiety,"Maybe I should have been the one to grovel, because I'd fucked up so bad over the situation.",1
5860,anxiety,I didn’t sleep that night and eventually was fine.,1
5861,anxiety,Since then my anxiety has gotten worse- scary movies linger in my thoughts a little longer.,1
5862,anxiety,I’ve had a few mini panic attacks.,1
5863,anxiety,I can’t get intoxicated anymore Bc I don’t like my mind being In a different state.,1
5864,anxiety,I feel like a darkness is over me and I just feel scared all the time.,1
5865,anxiety,Which forced me to acknowledge that I haven’t been performing to my own expectations.,1
5866,anxiety,Enter the anxiety attack.,1
5867,anxiety,"Sobbing, shaking, fidgeting, and rambling.",1
5868,anxiety,"To top it all off, I threw away my xanex thinking that I didn’t need the safety net.",1
5869,anxiety,I thought I was done with all this...reality proved otherwise.,1
5870,anxiety,"I live alone, make sure my dog gets the exercise he needs, I keep my apartment tidy, I do my laundry, I make sure I’m eating good, I work out, and I still hang with friends and such.",1
5871,anxiety,"Really, the only time I play video games is after work (which is normally after 8:30pm) or when I’m off.",1
5872,anxiety,"Even when I’m off, I still do chores and such between playing games.",1
5873,anxiety,"Even though I’m good at getting this stuff done, I still feel like there’s this weight on my shoulders that I should do MORE.",1
5874,anxiety,Even when I cut video games out of the equation (which I did for the last week and a half) I still don’t do MORE because I’m normally too tired to do anything else.,1
5875,anxiety,"Hey guys, I'm 31, moved to a new city with my wife for the first time back in October, and am experiencing on and off anxiety for more or less the first time in my life.",1
5876,anxiety,A couple quick questions: 1.,1
5877,anxiety,How do I know whether I should see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?,1
5878,anxiety,Today was a horrible day from the get go and I had to call out because I cant function with other people (I work in retail) today so I claimed I had a fever.,1
5879,anxiety,"Of course it had to be memorial day weekend making it one of the worst times for this and they even of course said over the phone ""Well, this really puts us in a bind"".",1
5880,anxiety,Now I'm absolutely paranoid that they'll find out or they hate me now or I'll get fired for this.,1
5881,anxiety,I'm so paranoid I'm worried they'll see me or come to my house to check on me even though I know they would never do that.,1
5882,anxiety,I just wish someone could understand or sympathize/empathize with me for once.,1
5883,anxiety,"I suffered a concussion a month ago and I noticed it really has provoked my anxiety to be scared about getting worse and it has even led to me getting depressed and thinking of harming myself I have been like this before, I have had anxiety but not to this level.",1
5884,anxiety,I have felt better since the concussion has healed but I am worried I won't recover from my anxiety and I have been perscribed Celprix (Escitalopram) and unsure if I should take it.,1
5885,anxiety,I kind of feel like I can recover from this by getter back to my routine and return to work.,1
5886,anxiety,Anyone else been through a life changing injury and had some bad anxiety from it?,1
5887,anxiety,"This post was spurred by the fact that I was just scrolling through photos I took of my boyfriend last year and I found myself thinking, ""is this person actually my boyfriend?""",1
5888,anxiety,"I don't mean that in a sappy ""how did I get so lucky"" way (although I did luck out with him, for sure) but more in a ""how do I see this person all the time and still feel like I don't recognize him in photos"" way.",1
5889,anxiety,We've been together for over five years.,1
5890,anxiety,It just... it doesn't make any sense.,1
5891,anxiety,"Normally I only do this with people from high school, many of whom I haven't seen since we graduated six years ago.",1
5892,anxiety,That freaked me out.,1
5893,anxiety,I was tired after probably from a sugar crash and I immediately assumed I was going through a calcium OD and was going to end up in a coma.,1
5894,anxiety,Then I went home and opened a Snapchat and got deja vu (I thought I read that Snapchat before).,1
5895,anxiety,"I experience deja vu like that frequently, and googled it and it said I could have a brain condition or epilepsy...",1
5896,anxiety,If I’m going to have to live like this forever sometimes I wish I wouldn’t wake up.,1
5897,anxiety,"My anxiety caused me to become independent and cold towards him, but inside I was screaming.",1
5898,anxiety,All I wanted was for him to hold me and tell me everything was fine.,1
5899,anxiety,But my anxiety got the best of us and caused a rift.,1
5900,anxiety,We broke up for a week and then when we got back together we were really good for maybe a month or two and the same insecurities slipped in.,1
5901,anxiety,"Mind you, he has NEVER cheated or even acted interested in other girls.",1
5902,anxiety,Every morning I wake up and it's there on the exact same spot.,1
5903,anxiety,This has been happening for the past 4 days and I thought I need to reach out to someone if they can help me at all?,1
5904,anxiety,"I have convinced myself I have a brain tumour, I keep feeling dissociated and completely out of it I keep touching the same spot on my head like every 20 seconds like a compulsion and it's really getting me down.",1
5905,anxiety,When I swallow i feel as if i can feel a pulling sensation near the spot where this is happening.,1
5906,anxiety,It's not exactly giving me a headache but it's disturbing me to which i notice it.,1
5907,anxiety,"I feel like I'm letting this take over my life, I'm constantly worried, about what if is more then just anxiety.",1
5908,anxiety,"I went to the university psychiatrist, after a 15 min talk he gave some pills and he book the next consultation for a mouth later.",1
5909,anxiety,The psychologist is impossible to book because is full.,1
5910,anxiety,"My parents are away they worry so much,  they want me to come home,  I live 5 hours away from them (this includes flying).",1
5911,anxiety,"I just don't know, I feel really insecure about all of this.",1
5912,anxiety,I know it’s terrible and selfish and obviously people can be friends with each other but I just miss having a really strong and healthy friendship with another girl the way that we did.,1
5913,anxiety,"I want to have a good weekend but it feels impossible now, and I want everyone there to have a good weekend and I don’t want to make it bad.",1
5914,anxiety,I don’t know what to do.,1
5915,anxiety,So I just feel like crawling into my little isolation hole and being sad by myself while knowing that everyone hates me... to be honest I don’t know why I’m overthinking it cause honestly no one would care if I did isolate myself.,1
5916,anxiety,"It’s just I want to be better, not just for other people but for myself too.",1
5917,anxiety,"In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply.",1
5918,anxiety,"Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything.""",1
5919,anxiety,"At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice).",1
5920,anxiety,Again understandable.,1
5921,anxiety,"I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",1
5922,anxiety,"Not a huge amount of weight, but it was a big deal for me.",1
5923,anxiety,I was on the treadmill every night for 45 minutes.,1
5924,anxiety,I was doing good.,1
5925,anxiety,Now I can't be on the treadmill or I start feeling ill again.,1
5926,anxiety,"Anyway, after the garbage issue I ended up in the hospital again.",1
5927,anxiety,I feel like I'm dying.,1
5928,anxiety,I know that I'm not but I feel like it.,1
5929,anxiety,I'm at the end of a cold.,1
5930,anxiety,"Not a cold that I sometimes make up in my head, but an actual cold.",1
5931,anxiety,"Stuffy nose, chest congestion, scratchy throat.",1
5932,anxiety,"Rarely, I forget about the symptoms.",1
5933,anxiety,"Rarely, they don't bother me, but they still are occurring always.",1
5934,anxiety,I have seen two different doctors about this.,1
5935,anxiety,They ruled out a few things and suggested that it was purely anxiety and that I go on an SSRI.,1
5936,anxiety,"I have not gone on an SSRI yet, however I am planning to do so ASAP.",1
5937,anxiety,So I'm currently in a decision if I suffer from social anxiety or not.,1
5938,anxiety,If I can I will ask ny step mom tonight as we like to watch TV at night diwn stairs with a cuo of tea but thats if she doesn't go to bed straight away.,1
5939,anxiety,I know I'm too scared and will just freeze up to ask her to stay down.,1
5940,anxiety,"I want to tell my step mom because I know she will tell my dad, I wouldn't be able to tell anyone else accept for my nan.",1
5941,anxiety,I'm in a really tough situation right now as I want to see a doctor or therapist about this but I need to tell someone first.,1
5942,anxiety,Itʻs at the point where I am scared I canʻt focus on driving and will crash or just space out going 45 mph.,1
5943,anxiety,"In the past Ive had 3 major ""panic attacks(?)""",1
5944,anxiety,where my whole body is in pins and needles and I canʻt breathe well but they were all triggered by major emotional events.,1
5945,anxiety,I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep.,1
5946,anxiety,I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didnʻt want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldnʻt want to compare my stress to that.,1
5947,anxiety,"""What is nothing is real?",1
5948,anxiety,"What if everything is a figment of your imagination?""",1
5949,anxiety,"I panicked, and grabbed the couch, but the voice inside me said ""It doesn't matter if you grab the couch, what is the couch isn't real?",1
5950,anxiety,"What if your house isn't real?""",1
5951,anxiety,"At this time I called my brother, sobbing, and told him to get my mom.",1
5952,anxiety,"I keep alternating between crying, laughing, and freaking out.",1
5953,anxiety,I'm also really upset right now and my boyfriend isn't making me feel better.,1
5954,anxiety,"He keeps saying things like, this is all your fault and no one is making you think these things.",1
5955,anxiety,And to be patient with things....,1
5956,anxiety,I feel like this is going to kill me?,1
5957,anxiety,My heart is palpitating because I finally responded in a group chat that I'm not so active in because I'm scared nobody is going to care what I say.,1
5958,anxiety,So I finally responded this morning because the chat seems active and it couldn't possibly hurt right?,1
5959,anxiety,I'm trying to beat my anxiety.,1
5960,anxiety,"Well, my fears were confirmed.",1
5961,anxiety,Nobody responded to what I texted.,1
5962,anxiety,I always feel like no one actually likes me and they just put up with me out of pity.,1
5963,anxiety,"It’s a vicious cycle, because that insecurity makes me more self-conscious and standoffish, which makes me more unlikeable.",1
5964,anxiety,I just feel like I’m nothing but a drain on everyone and an inconvenience.,1
5965,anxiety,"I’m constantly plagued by these thoughts about what a terrible person and I am, and it’s just so exhausting.",1
5966,anxiety,I wish I was normal.,1
5967,anxiety,"I am already accountable to my family, boyfriend, pets, co workers, etc and now I have to be accountable to these ppl I couldn’t give two shits about and they are counting on me and I hate the pressure so much.",1
5968,anxiety,I’m doing that awful thing where you just avoid avoid avoid.,1
5969,anxiety,Had to get this off my chest.,1
5970,anxiety,I feel like I’m going to vomit and I have gurgles/butterflies in my belly and I’ve had the anxiety runs all morning.,1
5971,anxiety,UGH.,1
5972,anxiety,I check on my mom several times a day and I KNOW it has to be annoying.,1
5973,anxiety,"I am trying to find the right medication but none seem to work for me, I go to therapy, and I talk about it — but I am so sick of feeling this way.",1
5974,anxiety,"I know it is temporary and that I won’t be this way forever, but right now, it sucks.",1
5975,anxiety,"I can’t sleep because I worry so much, it’s hard to focus at work because I worry so much, it’s hard to be social because I worry so much.",1
5976,anxiety,Thanks for listening.,1
5977,anxiety,"I had the depo shot for the first time at the beginning of March, decided to not go back for the 2nd because I wasn't a fan.",1
5978,anxiety,"Didn't experience any issues while on it , but once I came off of it, all hell broke loose.",1
5979,anxiety,My once controlled anxiety became out of control and I had random days where I felt depressed/crying spells.,1
5980,anxiety,"The intrusive thoughts were out of control, and had an anxiety attack the 2nd week of working at my new job.",1
5981,anxiety,"I had to leave work and go home, which hadn't happened in almost half a year.",1
5982,anxiety,Hey guys and girls.,1
5983,anxiety,"I've been going through a lot the past couple of years and was looking to maybe get some advice, or just find some people who can relate because I don't have that in my day to day life.",1
5984,anxiety,"I've tried to pinpoint where this started and this is the best I can come up with, and sorry if it gets long.",1
5985,anxiety,I've had closure issues since I was 12 and my grandpa passed away.,1
5986,anxiety,I cut myself off from any meaningful relationships including my family for over 5 years.,1
5987,anxiety,"Now here I am, jobless and not in education.",1
5988,anxiety,A useless person.,1
5989,anxiety,I'm too anxious and to get a job because I knew that I would screw up and face angry people.,1
5990,anxiety,"I've seen so many therapists but they don't help much, just said that it's a teenage problem.",1
5991,anxiety,2 months of lexapro didn't do much but at least I got my muse back.,1
5992,anxiety,I've been trying multiple medications for 20 years and I have literally tried them all.,1
5993,anxiety,The highest doses possible of insomnia medication can't even put me to sleep.,1
5994,anxiety,Multiple psychiatrist and even my pharmacist are stumped.,1

6490,anxiety,That fact that I was not born with a generalized anxiety disorder really makes me believe that one day I’ll be able to be the person I was before the incident.,1
6491,anxiety,"The issue is that even when I ask my therapist about this he tells me that my anxiety will always be there from now on, I just have to learn how to deal with it.",1

6787,anxiety,I disagree.,1
6788,anxiety,Has anybody felt this way or had an experience with serotonin being too high?,1
6789,anxiety,Then i start getting jaw aches and collarbone pain or back pain and I have been to A+E several times and every time I am healthy bar one time i had a chest wall muscle inflammation.,1

6814,anxiety,I've also had positive experiences with police.,1
6815,anxiety,The resource officer at my high school was a really good guy and almost like a mentor to me.,1
6816,anxiety,When I was 17 I was arrested when police raided a friends house because they were tipped off that there was to be some under-aged drinking.,1
6817,anxiety,I won't go into too much detail but what stems off of that is thoughts of being and feeling worthless like I'm not good enough for anyone and that I'm undeserving of the good things given to me but then another thought stems off of that one which would be something along the lines of me thinking how stupid I was acting and then another thought after that and so on.,1
6818,anxiety,Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much).,1
6819,anxiety,"Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible.",1
6820,anxiety,Other than that though I'm quite optimistic and I tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person!,1
6821,anxiety,I'm seeing someone about these problems but I just thought I'd ask if anyone has any extra advice they could give if things start to get a bit out of control.,1
6822,anxiety,I hope I can remember that my anxiety was misguided and ultimately wrong.,1
6823,anxiety,"And more than that, I hope that whoever reads this (if anyone does) can remember it too.",1
6824,anxiety,"I wasn't sure how to end this before, and I am not sure how to end it now, so I will leave you with one of my favorite quotes from the great Stanley Kubrick...  ***""And remember no matter how vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.",1

6830,anxiety,one day i broke down into absolute tears and was rushed into the counselers office.,1
6831,anxiety,at this point im in 8th grade and this is by no means acceptable behavior.,1
6832,anxiety,we are about to go into high school and i just burst into a ball of tears in front of every last one of my peers.,1

6849,anxiety,"I've also heard Trazodone may be an option, for someone who wants SSRI-like-effects without any activation.",1
6850,anxiety,"Additionally, my Psych doctor mentioned Gabapentin as a way to directly target anxiety without any of the long-term concerns of daily benzo use.",1
6851,anxiety,(though I've read it's not without its own drawbacks.),1
6852,anxiety,"Obviously, this wouldn't have any serotonergic effect, but could be a good alternative to the Xanax.",1
6853,anxiety,"Anyway, long story short, he came over, we had a blast, we had dinner, watched a movie, cuddled, and he fell asleep on me.",1
6854,anxiety,Four nights later the same thing happened :-) On our second date he told me he had anxiety issues and I just tried to listen to him.,1
6855,anxiety,"He's Spanish so English is his second language, which probably doesn't help his anxiety when talking to an American.",1
6856,anxiety,Last night he came over and he told me had anxiety and depression issues and he's seeing a doctor.,1
6857,anxiety,"The first six months I had her she lived in a cage that could have fit two rats, the next year and a half she lived in a cage that could have fit four rats (this is following the formula where you multiply the dimensions of the cage in inches and divide it by 3456.",1
6858,anxiety,I loved buying her new toys and treats and seeing how she took them.,1
6859,anxiety,Trying new foods on her was one of my favorite things to do.,1
6860,anxiety,The only issue is that I didn't really let her out of the cage much.,1
6861,anxiety,"Edit 2: This thread got so much more attention than I could have imagined, there's been so many people offering advice and sharing their life experiences.",1
6862,anxiety,I don't think I've ever seen so much helpfulness and friendliness on the internet before and I just want to say thank you.,1

6879,anxiety,I struggle with open spaces.,1
6880,anxiety,But I walked in and signed up!,1

6882,anxiety,"things you wouldn't want to be ""wrong"" or ""under threat"".",1

6896,anxiety,I was sat on the sofa with my girlfriend and all of a sudden we could hear our flat door being pushed as if someone was trying to get in...,1

6904,anxiety,"So, I used tap water in a neti pot.",1
6905,anxiety,My cold seemed to get worse right after.,1
6906,anxiety,"I googled, “Can a neti pot make a cold worse?” Suddenly, information appears that if you use tap water in a neti pot you can get that brain eating amoeba, Naegleria fowleri... (the same one that kills kids who swim in fresh water).",1

6920,anxiety,"Then she called me an Indian giver and I asked if I should just give them to her and she said ""i dont know, do what you want i guess"".",1
6921,anxiety,Her granddaughter was playing loudly with a balloon and asked me if I wanted to play with her and I said not right now.,1
6922,anxiety,"Then the landlord was like ""I thought you liked kids??",1
6923,anxiety,"She has no teeth (from abuse or just from scavenging on the streets we’re not sure), perfectly behaved, sweet, trusting, and most gentle dog you’ve ever met.",1
6924,anxiety,No dog or human aggression at all.,1
6925,anxiety,So if I adopted her I could also keep fostering as well.,1
6926,anxiety,I’ve been fostering her for about 3 weeks now.,1

2993,relationships,"For context, I'm working through my last year of grad school, living alone currently with not many strong friendships in the area, and my Dad has been dying of cancer since September, so it's a stressful and lonely time.",0

3002,relationships,My problem is that one of the acquaintances is giving me a lot of power play-type problems.,0
3003,relationships,"For example, I'll request *four times* in three different mediums we use, to email contributions to an end-of-year favorites list and rather than do that, she put hers on a share drive and told others to do the same in spite of my multiple requests to email me instead for better ease of sharing.",0
3004,relationships,Emails are met with snarky responses or half-measures which mean I still have to chase down.,0

3008,relationships,"I know his class schedule, so I know when we can answer back (he checks his phone often).",0
3009,relationships,"She approached me and started to say something but I interrupted saying, “If this is about my phone, I am under no obligation to share with you anything that is spoken between me and a therapist, and I do not care that this is during work, I have an emergency number to call at any time when I feel like I have to, and I felt like this was important as I don’t want to go back to the psych ward.” She stopped and just said “oh, ok sorry.” I understand that this may be a negative on my performance at work, and I may not be entirely right, but I have cut myself at work (not during work but after shift and right outside at my car) and the way I was feeling I needed emergency counseling.",0
3010,relationships,"I have tried to have a conversation with her before about how I was feeling, but it didn’t go so well since she felt like I was being rude, so while I am open to trying again, I want to know how I should go about it again and/or should I get the manager involved?",0
3011,relationships,Thank you for reading and I appreciate any and all responses.,0
3012,relationships,"Three of them said ""so sorry I actually can't"" and gave some noncommittal excuse, whether that was work or school related (even though school only started up again about a week ago and midterms are far away).",0
3013,relationships,I was disappointed but figured that it happens and I can still have fun with the three other people that are coming.,0
3014,relationships,"Only to wake up the next day and have the other three friends text me that they couldn't come either for varying reasons and they were ""so sorry"".",0
3015,relationships,"I had told my mom about it and she had told me that what I didn't realize was that none of them were really my close friends, since people that are actually friends don't flake out like that, plus none of them have ever come over to my place or vice versa or done anything more than hang out every now and then.",0
3016,relationships,"I got my review in Dec. and I was supposed to get a raise if I did well, but they gave me a bonus instead and I know I should be grateful I got anything but it wasn't what I needed and I can't get another job at the moment, nothing in the area is hiring for more than what I make at the moment.",0

3022,relationships,We have our own space but the common area is shared.,0
3023,relationships,She has expressed that she doesn't like the living situation but the fact that it is cheap and we are all locked into a lease has prevented me from making any changes.,0

3041,relationships,"Over the years, I have always known that his parents don't absolutely love me but I didn't realize that they actually dislike me until this time I visited them.",0
3042,relationships,"His dad is a difficult person to begin with, which is well known by everyone and he kept making little jabs at me and insulting me.",0
3043,relationships,"For example, he asked if I am a citizen and how long I have been one, I mentioned that I have never watched Harry Potter and he ""jokingly"" asked me if I was busy clubbing and talking to boys and doubted my upbringing, and when I was using my bfs phone, he asked me why I am using it and if I am reading his texts.",0

3072,relationships,He assured her he won’t cut off contact; is he in love with her?,0
3073,relationships,After a few days I start to try to make plans with her to hang out or go out to eat even if its only for an hour or so.,0

3101,relationships,"I've asked him to hide it from me from now on and expressed how hurt it was, but I went to use his gaming system a couple of days ago and saw he was still looking it up regularly (I guess he thought I wouldn't use it - I had gone to look up something and all the searches popped up in the Bing bar).",0
3102,relationships,I know rationally that men like variety.,0
3103,relationships,But I haven't sent him nudes in probably two months now.,0

3163,relationships,"My mom doesn’t want us to do anything because she lives in fear and is hoping to wait until I graduate (I’m in 11th grade so we would have to wait a year and we really can’t/shouldn’t) so she can divorce him, she only wants to wait because she can’t support us by herself.",0
3164,relationships,"If we do move I would be fine with getting a full-time job to support my family, I’m already a private tutor but I only do 1-hr a week for $20.",0

3192,relationships,I spoke with her after all was said and done and asked why.,0
3193,relationships,"Reasons she gave me were that I didn't do enough housework and she felt underappreciated for the work she did, that my libido is considerably higher that hers and it made her feel inadequate so she went outside the marriage to feel more like she could satisfy a person's sex drive, and that I'm boring and the newness of everything was gone.",0

3204,relationships,We get along great but I’ve always felt that our relationship has lacked an emotional aspect on his part.,0
3205,relationships,Part of the reason I want to end it also has to do with our financial situation - we’re both broke but I want to start working more to save more money because I’m trying to be more financially independent.,0

3211,relationships,"As mentioned above, my girlfriends gets pissed off when I act uninterested in her friends and starts accusing me of hating them, which is ridiculous because I hardly even know them, and she gets really upset and stops talking to me for awhile.",0

3310,relationships,This is something I'm working on figuring out for myself).,0
3311,relationships,Option 2: We each move after we each get a job in City A.,0
3312,relationships,Drawbacks: (1) one of us will be left at our current job for a while with our boss and coworkers knowing the other is likely to leave soon after.,0
3313,relationships,"(2) BF will likely find a job first, as he has a few more years experience than me plus some management experience.",0
3314,relationships,"**TL;DR - SO of over a decade is great to me in many ways and shit to me in other ways, I feel awful when he's shit to me but also feel guilty as fuck about expressing it because of all the times he's amazing to me.",0
3315,relationships,"Our relationship is rock solid, I'm not leaving him.",0
3316,relationships,"Now, I know her brother can be pretty psychotic and from what shes told me he clearly has anger issues and the rest of her family keeps ignoring it, sometimes even enabling it.",0
3317,relationships,"So 2 minutes into her exploding, she starts crying because apparently her brother told their dad something and the dad called her and said he doesn't trust her anymore or whatever.",0
3318,relationships,She was very upset about the dad thing because she's very close with her dad and she's her dads favorite child (he told me that himself when I spoke with him).,0
3319,relationships,"I didn't want to pry too much because I felt like it isn't exactly my business of their internal family issues, but my girlfriend screenshot the text messages her brother sent her and I just could not comprehend how a human being, especially a sibling, can say that to someone.",0
3320,relationships,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, he's in college and he wants to work to have extra spending money, his friend who works at a restaurant said that he'd help him get a job there.",0
3321,relationships,"The staff at this restaurant are at least 90% female and I'm not really okay with this, I don't know what to say to him about it so I haven't mentioned the thing about other girls, but I have expressed that I would rather he not get a job.",0
3322,relationships,"My family is from Chile and my father had an investors Visa and that is how we got to the US, my parents are very well off and I have told my boyfriend that I'd be completely fine with financially supporting him at least even just while he's in school, and he said he still wants a job ""for the social aspect as well"".",0
3323,relationships,"Which kinda seemed odd to me, why would he want job for the social aspect even if he doesn't need the money?",0
3324,relationships,When the job is at a place that is over 90% female?,0
3325,relationships,She seems to want to have longer conversations about her emotions every day.,0
3326,relationships,I'm trying to work on my studies.,0
3327,relationships,"tldr: I'd really, really appreciate some advice.",0
3328,relationships,"Please don't just comment ""break up with her"".",0
3329,relationships,"She says she wants to have her own space to go to when she wants to be at ease, ""not that she doesn't feel at ease with me, it's just different"".",0
3330,relationships,"I tried to make her see that we're supposed to make a new home for ourselves where we will both feel at ease, but to no avail.",0
3331,relationships,TLDR: going through a rough patch where husband was abusive and raging.,0
3332,relationships,"My mom finally had a response, basically my brother works very hard (and he does, he does manual work, which I know is very hard) but nothing regarding me.",0
3333,relationships,"my brother stays out of everything, he is kind and asks me questions but doesn't play games with my sister and is usually out of the room doing something.",0
3334,relationships,"I think about her often, not even necessarily in a sexual manner, but I miss her.",0
3335,relationships,"Even more so, the fantasies have started up again.",0
3336,relationships,"I come from an Asian family where kids are not expected to move out, its the opposite where kids are supposed to live at home and take care of the parents when they become adults, however living in America has made me hate this mindset because I am never able to be an individual.",0
3337,relationships,"My dad is extremely controlling and a downright bully, he verbally abuses me and my siblings about anything possible just for the sake of abusing us.",0
3338,relationships,"He even abuses my mom verbally and she knows it but deals with because its how she was raised, even random strangers like waiters and cashiers at stores are bullied, he'll complain about lines being long and blame cashiers for being ""slow"" ect.",0
3339,relationships,"TL;DR: I wish to ask out my longtime friend this Valentines, but I am afraid of my past coming back and ruining my renewed trust with both her and my friends that I’ve worked years to repair.",0
3340,relationships,That’s what is keeping me up at night.,0
3341,relationships,I look forward to what the community has to say.,0
3342,relationships,Apparently it has been going on since the day they moved in together.,0
3343,relationships,Since her husband is a good friend of me and my husband it's kinda weird for me to say 'leave him' or 'get out' I don't want to influence any decision she makes.,0
3344,relationships,"Does anyone have any similar experience and were you able to become functioning friends with your ex or was it best to cut all ties, even if it meant losing friends?",0
3345,relationships,TL;DR Broke up with my girlfriend of ten years because she fell in love with a complete stranger from overseas.,0
3346,relationships,Have shared friends and can’t seem to shake the feeling of sadness/anger whenever I see her due to our reason for breaking up.,0
3347,relationships,Should I cut her out of my life and lose friends or make more of an effort to be friendly/peaceful towards her?,0
3348,relationships,"We've been getting along very well, and our previous repeated complaints on both sides of ceased because of this.",0
3349,relationships,But as time has gone on my feelings have changed in regards to me thinking I can accept this and work through it with her.,0
3350,relationships,"I know I love her, and I don't really know how to explain my emotions here, but I no longer feel like ""her husband"", and I don't feel like she's ""my wife"", it's more like we're partners or room mates or something.",0
3351,relationships,"I feel a vital part of our marriage (loyalty, and trust) is gone and it can't come back.",0
3352,relationships,My boyfriend constantly states that we are no longer in a relationship and I need to be constantly working towards showing him that he will want to be with me again.,0
3353,relationships,I do 90% of the cooking and cleaning in the house.,0
3354,relationships,"It’s almost a 50/50 mindset, because on one hand she wouldn’t ever wish to be thought of or treated in a horrid way, I have corrected it best I can, and she is the kind of person to forgive and forget.",0
3355,relationships,So that’s why I’m here today people of Reddit.,0
3356,relationships,"I realize this isn’t the most pressing, serious, or dramatic post on here, but I stick my hand out in the hopes you can give me some guidance, some past experience, wisdom, or advice on what I can do or try so that the “here and now” are in question, and not “then and there”, so that my confession can go along without regret.",0
3357,relationships,"I of course understand her wanting me to be safe, but I have an IUD and use condoms 100% of the time, which she knows because she pries about my sex life.",0
3358,relationships,She knows I'm sexually active and I don't have a boyfriend and is really judgmental about me having casual sex.,0
3359,relationships,I had a pregnancy scare last week (I'm not pregnant) and all I wanted was some advice from my mom and she used it as a way to make me feel bad about my sex life.,0
3360,relationships,"When I was younger, she would constantly slut-shame me for things I hadn't even done, and made me feel so guilty about the idea of even having sex that I didn't have sex even with my year-long high school boyfriend because of this crippling guilt.",0
3361,relationships,Whenever we argue she makes it a time to critique my entire personality and not just my behavior in that argument or even within my relationship with her.,0
3362,relationships,"I’m also quite intellectual, I can speak 2 languages other than my native language, English and Japanese.",0
3363,relationships,"But I only want my boyfriend, he has a shy personality but he’s very knowledgeable, he’s like a walking Wikipedia and I love him so much.",0
3364,relationships,"He makes me feel calm just laughing at our inside jokes, receiving a cute text from him, and ever since being in a relationship with him I’ve grown to be happy with the smallest things in life.",0
3365,relationships,"All of this really took a toll of our relationship, to the point that we hardly called anymore or had any communication.",0
3366,relationships,"Update - Thanks all, I have calmed down a bit now.",0
3367,relationships,Will sleep on it and hopefully tackle with a clearer head tomorrow.,0
3368,relationships,"--- **tl;dr**: Found out from stranger on Facebook my partner is most likely going to leave me, feel betrayed she posted it on a public forum like Facebook.",0
3369,relationships,"Right now feeling useless, am introverted and quiet by nature so I don’t have much of a support network.",0
3370,relationships,"When we returned a year ago, we had some very rough boundary issues (trying to forward face in their car, feeding baby junk, criticizing our parenting choices, etc.)",0
3371,relationships,with them.,0
3372,relationships,"MIL has ""anxiety and depression"" and cannot address the issues she causes so FIL addresses them for her.",0
3373,relationships,"She does not see a mental health professional (because narcissist) and blames everyone else for any wrong she may do, which of course she does no wrong.",0
3374,relationships,Should I chill out and let her contact me?,0
3375,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: The level of communication outside of face-to-face interaction is making it difficult to maintain attraction and to set up plans with the woman I am dating, and it has become worse the last couple weeks despite our in-person interactions being consistently great.",0
3376,relationships,---   **tl;dr**: Older brother psychologically and physically abuses me and my younger brother.,0
3377,relationships,The messages are essentially the guy being flirtatious and asking her to come over to his place.,0
3378,relationships,My gf’s responses are not flirtatious but definitely welcoming.,0
3379,relationships,She responded to his offer by saying “how about we meet halfway and grab some lunch together some time”.,0
3380,relationships,She never told me that she was even still in contact with this guy.,0
3381,relationships,"And their relationship was explicitly sexual, not friendly.",0
3382,relationships,"But this time if she ordered me a shot, I gave it away.",0
3383,relationships,"I'm one of the only friends left who will go out to eat or drink with her, and I don't want to do it anymore.",0
3384,relationships,"She is worrisomely thin, and I don't think she'll live another 5 years.",0
3385,relationships,I honestly think the only calories she retains are from alcohol.,0
3386,relationships,"It wasn't a trap (like, wth?)",0
3387,relationships,"I love the guy, but lately I've been thinking almost on daily basis whether to put an end to the relationship.",0
3388,relationships,We’ve been together for two and half years but went through a rough patch not too long ago because I shipped off to basic.,0
3389,relationships,"But now that I’m back we were good but now her depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies are pushing me away.",0
3390,relationships,Not her shrink or doctor.,0
3391,relationships,"(BTW, we have talked about all of this about 1,957 times already.",0
3392,relationships,There is nothing written here he hasn’t heard before.),0
3393,relationships,"TL;DR – Husband has always been the primary earner with well-paying jobs, but has experienced serious burn-out.",0
3394,relationships,"As we’re eating into our savings, it looks like I’ll have to put my business on hold and go back to work.",0
3395,relationships,"This feels like my entire life, with everyone I've ever expected to love and care for me.",0
3396,relationships,"TL;DR I know my boyfriend is probably on drugs, or at least was actively using for some period of time recently, and you will probably agree with me if you read the evidence.",0
3397,relationships,"She wants to live off these 400.00 and cut back on everything there is, even her own only connection back to her family if needed.",0
3398,relationships,"My plan was, to get back to our parents for a while, until we both earn a bit better or find a cheaper place.",0
3399,relationships,"But unfortunately, for her this is no option.",0
3400,relationships,"She is afraid she can't go home, as she already once switched jobs and is afraid her mother won't accept her at home again.",0
3401,relationships,She blocks every attempt of mine to bring up the possibility of going back.,0
3402,relationships,She's been doing exams as of late and we've both had some personal problems so we haven't had time to work on our relationship.,0
3403,relationships,We both said we would stay together but sort it all out after she came back from a holiday she was going on with her uni.,0
3404,relationships,On the second last night she tells me she has kissed another guy and feels horrific about it.,0
3405,relationships,"I've always put her needs before mine, i've tried to give her everything and be the perfect boyfriend and because my natural defense mechanism is to retreat into my shell and shut the world out I don't reply to her texts that day.",0
3406,relationships,---   **tl;dr**: My fiance completely cuts himself off from our son and me and sulks for days if his sports teams lose.,0
3407,relationships,"I am tired of having to plan our lives around his teams and cancel plans when they lose, but he doesn't see a problem.",0
3408,relationships,And he said that he had some deep feelings for me.,0
3409,relationships,So I suggested meeting at another time without booze.,0
3410,relationships,In the morning I had a text from him apologising for being an asshole.,0
3411,relationships,"I replied and said I didn't think that, but that I was a little overwhelmed.",0
3412,relationships,"Since then I have not heard much from him, but I can't stop thinking about it.",0
3413,relationships,"He explained that he didn’t think it was such a big deal that he disclosed such personal information about me without my permission to his friends then he tried to flip it and said it was no different then a time I canceled plans with a friend and told them the reason was because he, Tom was sick with the flu and I was going to stay in and take care of him.",0
3414,relationships,"How is me honestly explaining that the reason I would have to cancel on a friend because my boyfriend is sick, the same as him giving away very detailed information about our sex life plus other very personal traumas that I experienced without my permission?",0
3415,relationships,TL;DR my boyfriend told his friends VERY detailed information about our sex life plus other personal things about my life without my permission and I feel so betrayed but he’s trying to act like it’s no big deal.,0
3416,relationships,I just feel kinda gross because I was giving her fucking college advice and stuff.,0
3417,relationships,My clearest memory of my dad in highschool is him ramming my head repeatedly into a wall because I didn't want to pick engineering as a *second choice*.,0
3418,relationships,He even skipped out on my graduation!,0
3419,relationships,"The few days following this I was a wreck, an absolute mess.",0
3420,relationships,The other night I told him I needed an answer.,0
3421,relationships,"I want to focus on me and my things without having to think about her and what she’s doing all the time, so I can be less distracted and focused on my other priorities.",0
3422,relationships,"TL;DR I want to focus on my priorities in life but I find myself getting wrapped up in my thoughts about what where, and what my girlfriend is doing.",0
3423,relationships,"For example, when I suggest we do something or go somewhere that could be somewhat unique/interesting (e.g., watching a documentary about sex workers in their 60s, or going to a church in Vienna to listen to the choir boys sing), his first reaction via text is ""wtf?""",0
3424,relationships,"When I confront him about it, he says he ""wasn't saying it to me.""",0
3425,relationships,His excuse is that he was saying wtf about [insert whatever the subject matter was].,0
3426,relationships,"For example, she told me I was too stubborn.",0
3427,relationships,"This is definitely true but she criticized my political opinions, my social behaviors, and my pop culture opinions in addition to just my relationship with her.",0
3428,relationships,"She also constantly mocks me when we fight, literally repeating my words back to me in a childish/cartoony voice and putting words in my mouth.",0
3429,relationships,She refuses to listen to my point of view.,0
3430,relationships,We recently got into a fight where I thought a Christmas present my father had gotten me was cheaper than it was.,0
3431,relationships,He doesn't have to spend a load of money on things I like!,0
3432,relationships,He can use it to spend on himself.,0
3433,relationships,"I enjoy being spoiled but only when I'm the one spoiling myself, haha.",0
3434,relationships,And this doesn’t even include what they may do when I’m not around!,0
3435,relationships,"Also, whenever roommate will talk about boys or finding a boyfriend, I notice husband will quickly try to shut that idea down fast, and say he knows roommate isn’t attracted to said guy or doesn’t want/need a boyfriend.",0
3436,relationships,There’s definitely an emotional dependency there.,0
3437,relationships,I know my husband has explained to me over and over how much he helps her and how important he is in her life.,0
3438,relationships,"I was in a rabbit hole of youtube videos over the weekend, starting off from music videos, then vine compilations, and then somehow fight videos.",0
3439,relationships,"On one of the side videos, I noticed a video involving ""XYZ high school"" where my boyfriend attended.",0
3440,relationships,The video was actually pretty clear and my blood kind of ran cold when I realized one of the 2 kids in the video was my boyfriend.,0
3441,relationships,And there's no doubt that this was him.,0
3442,relationships,"He apologizes if I point it out later, but the first instinct is always to blame me.",0
3443,relationships,"He doesn't hide it at all even if we're around other people, so I have to be particularly cautious not to piss him off or bring up anything that could upset him in public.",0
3444,relationships,"When he's upset/displeased in private, he withdraws and it's up to me to grovel and convince him to talk to me again.",0
3445,relationships,"Even when she hated me, I didn't hate her.",0
3446,relationships,I can't describe it.,0
3447,relationships,"She and my mom were chatting at dinner (they're the talkers of the family), and the whole time, I was just glaring at her.",0
3448,relationships,"She tried talking to me, and I felt my entire body physically tense, and I was just viscerally angry.",0
3449,relationships,"It's just annoying to be invited to come over and thinking you're gonna have some bro time gaming and what not, only to get there have him drop the bomb that his GF is coming over and being stuck between either listening to 5th grade cheesy/cringeworthy convos or figuring a way to bail early without coming across as an asshole.",0
3450,relationships,"How can I talk with my buddy in a polite way about the matter, that when he invites me over I'd prefer it to be bro time without coming across as an asshole or that I'm against his GF as a person which I'm totally not!",0
3451,relationships,"Again, she's really sweet and he has every right to want his GF to come over to, I'm just tired of the surprise third wheel through the most goose bump inducing conversations and want some strategies how I can communicate with my friend that I don't like sitting through that.",0
3452,relationships,Thanks in advance!,0
3453,relationships,"We had plans to move in together, a fancy $1,800/month home that she would contribute $400 or so.",0
3454,relationships,"We spoke of children, marriage, all sorts of stuff.",0
3455,relationships,It's not that I thought she owed me anything for me doing these things.,0
3456,relationships,"It's just that I felt like I did so incredibly much and it kills me that I look back and know that over a 5 month period, we only had intimate contact less than 15 times, that we never made out, outside sex (and I initiated and was rejected many, many times).",0
3457,relationships,"Every time I brought up my frustrations regarding my unmet romantic needs, she took it as gaslighting and used it as fuel to further drive the reason why she wasn't comfortable with intimate contact.",0
3458,relationships,"Okay, So in since October have just got out of an eight year relationship .",0
3459,relationships,"We were engaged to get married next year, but it did not work out.",0
3460,relationships,It ended mutually and we have moved on.,0
3461,relationships,In life these things happen.,0
3462,relationships,Since Halloween I have been seeing this Girl.,0
3463,relationships,"I have a twin sister, Audrey, and I hate her.",0
3464,relationships,"We both came home for our mom's birthday, and I couldn't even spend 20 minutes with her.",0
3465,relationships,We're really different people.,0
3466,relationships,I think now she feels some of responsibility to help those in need and she gets a lot of gratification from these people who are very thankful to her.,0
3467,relationships,"On occasion when we go out, we have been approached by these people and I can tell they are very grateful to her.",0
3468,relationships,"We were at Starbucks while she's studying and the husband/wife she helped offered to buy her coffee, etc ... Lastly, her other dream is to get a house in this very rich neighborhood with houses that cost $2M at the very least.",0
3469,relationships,"Anyways, enough with the bad, now the good things about her.",0
3470,relationships,She is a very loving person which is proven by the fact that everyone loves her at work.,0
3471,relationships,"After college for about 2 years, I focused on my career and wasn't totally putting myself out there.",0
3472,relationships,"Now, for the last year, I've actively put myself in the dating pool.",0
3473,relationships,"It never seemed appealing to hang around in clubs or bars to hopefully pick someone up, so I've mostly stuck to online dating.",0
3474,relationships,"I was mostly pretty casually looking, and would go on there when the mood struck me or I was speaking to someone I saw potential with.",0
3475,relationships,"Over the course of the last about 2.5 months, I've been on 3 dates.",0
3476,relationships,"I was never really close to him, our conversations never went past the 'nice weather we're having' area.",0
3477,relationships,"But I coincidentally ran into him at a bar recently and I initially tried to keep my distance from him because I know he's friends with Zach, but then he told me that not only does he and Zach are no longer in contact with each other, they actually really dislike each other now.",0
3478,relationships,I'm guessing something went down after Zach and I broke up.,0
3479,relationships,"After that, I was more comfortable around him.",0
3480,relationships,"So, as the night went along and we got drunker, we ended up hooking up.",0
3481,relationships,"We are 100% no contact, and have decided we won't talk to each other for at least a few months, or until we're ready to talk and maybe try to be friends.",0
3482,relationships,"He says he still cares deeply for me and loves me, but this is for the best.",0
3483,relationships,What advice do y'all have?,0
3484,relationships,Thanks!,0
3485,relationships,I've been with Mike for 4 years now.,0
3486,relationships,"We have an amazing relationship and I never felt bothered by anything in it, not even silly arguments that are more than common between a couple.",0
3487,relationships,Mike has a best friend named Theo.,0
3488,relationships,"Theo is a cute guy who never seems to settle down, but not in a womanizer way, more like, he hasn't found the one.",0
3489,relationships,"Well, hadn't found the one.",0
3490,relationships,"After meeting last year, Amanda and Isaac became incredibly close and agreed to live together for their Senior year.",0
3491,relationships,"This past November, Amanda got drunk at a party and ended up making out with a random guy (on Jeff's birthday).",0
3492,relationships,"Because of this, Amanda told Jeff that she wanted to take a break.",0
3493,relationships,Lots of drama.,0
3494,relationships,"Everyone was shocked because from the outside, Amanda and Jeff seemed to have a really strong relationship (dating for 4+ years).",0
3495,relationships,Her parents supported her.,0
3496,relationships,"I told her I thought it was a bad idea, that she should finish what she had left (she's an excellent student, super smart and committed) and then go to study the other career.",0
3497,relationships,But if she decided to leave I would support her 100%.,0
3498,relationships,She decided to quit.,0
3499,relationships,"The other career was in another town, my home town (<2hs away) she rented an apartment with 2 girls and moved away.",0
3500,relationships,"(I should note, our first year together we went to the Maldives, second year we bought a house & went to Croatia, Venice, Belgium, Lots of weekends away - I'm not exactly lacking trips away) *I'm content and rarely feel unhappy these days, but is that a replacement of happiness?",0
3501,relationships,* Is this just a January blues thing that will go as the year starts moving on and I get back into the swing of things?,0
3502,relationships,I was dealing with depression for months feeling like I'd failed life at 18 and quit my job to finish off my college education and thats where we met.,0
3503,relationships,We were in the same class and used to stare at each other all day long so i followed her on instagram and noticed she was going to a club in my town that night so convinced my friend to come out as i really needed to bump into this girl and give it a shot.,0
3504,relationships,so we did.,0
3505,relationships,"When i walked in, she was there it, was crazy we locked eyes and without saying much she walked up and just started kissing me.",0
3506,relationships,we were guy and girl from that moment we did so much stuff together like holidays then she even moved into my parents place.,0
3507,relationships,Really hoping someone might have some insight for me!,0
3508,relationships,"A couple years ago I (31,F) befriended one of colleagues (28,M).",0
3509,relationships,"We were working for a small company that was also hemorrhaging cash, and eventually it was just him, me and some older coworkers in this open space office.",0
3510,relationships,"Anyway, we really got along!",0
3511,relationships,"We would have lunches, text in the evenings and weekends, and often go to the pub after work.",0
3512,relationships,They were late.,0
3513,relationships,"They tried to play it cool with the excuse they gave, but J had this grin on his face and Lux had the flushes look she gets when she has sex.",0
3514,relationships,And then Lux said she was going to fix her hair and left to the bathroom and after a while J said he was going to see if she needed help.,0
3515,relationships,Obviously they left to have sex.,0
3516,relationships,"I mean, fine, but I thought that was a bit disrespectful.",0
3517,relationships,But 19 and 39?,0
3518,relationships,to me I feel like that is someone older than my current age dating an age that seems like a child to me....,0
3519,relationships,"I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a "" normal"" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any "" life skills"" and his answer was ""  not really"".",0
3520,relationships,What are people's thoughts on this?,0
3521,relationships,"The other problem is, I genuinely believe Brian's father wants a relationship with our daughter.",0
3522,relationships,to which he replied that they had broken up.,0
3523,relationships,We met for drinks and he gave a heartfelt apology for having pressured me.,0
3524,relationships,"Slowly, we began seeing more of each other and the relationship turned physical.",0
3525,relationships,"We both live in the Pacific Northwest, but he's going to be moving to his hometown in the southeast at the end of this month.",0
3526,relationships,I'm moving to the southwest next month.,0
3527,relationships,"Okay so a bit of background, me and my girlfriend are in our second year of college (my subjects make a freshman though hehe) and have been together for 6 months.",0
3528,relationships,I want to be an ambassador and she wants to go into marketing.,0
3529,relationships,"Every day we spend time together, there isn't a moment where the two of us don't end up talking about our future.",0
3530,relationships,"To be more specific, we always end up talking extensively about marriage, what to name our daughter, how many golden retrievers to get and the like.",0
3531,relationships,"Don't get me wrong, I love her to bits and I enjoy talking to her about these things, it's just that I'm slightly worried that maybe she is in love with the idea of me, and I with the idea of her.",0
3532,relationships,I'm running out of ideas for how we can talk to one another more often.,0
3533,relationships,She'll be starting grad school in August.,0
3534,relationships,"I've been through grad school already myself, and I know how time consuming it is.",0
3535,relationships,She'll be busy.,0
3536,relationships,Neither one at all my fault but thanks for thinking it is.,0
3537,relationships,tl;dr We broke up.,0
3538,relationships,"If dude is so in love with his solitude he can have it, if he's so worried about resentment and arguments he doesn't have to worry about those either.",0
3539,relationships,Maybe next time he'll think about what he wants and is willing to do before he opens his mouth.,0
3540,relationships,and how that would intersect with a potential partner’s attitude.,0
3541,relationships,You’ve probably seen the posts on here: a woman gave birth four months ago and her husband is pissed off because her breasts are sore and he can’t play with them.,0
3542,relationships,A woman gave birth three months ago and her husband is pressuring her for PiV sex even though she is still uncomfortable.,0
3543,relationships,"A woman doesn’t enjoy sexual play with her breasts anymore after breastfeeding because it’s a mammary gland and not a sex organ, and the husband gets pissed because he wants to touch her breasts and apparently isn’t aware of other erogenous zones.",0
3544,relationships,"These were posts I remember reading on here for some relevant examples, but I can go on.",0
3545,relationships,"**TL;DR** **BF thinks being called a lady jokingly is an insult and emasculating, I disagree, what do ?",0
3546,relationships,"Hi everyone, I'm not sure if this goes here or under parenting.",0
3547,relationships,"I met ""Bob"" in a big city, moved with him to his parents property to start a business/farm.",0
3548,relationships,"He immediately went into 30,000 debt building an unnecessary smithy and had to get a job so we couldn't start the business after all.",0
3549,relationships,"I bought a used car so I could get out sometimes and look for a job, he took the car to work (instead of his retired parent's car as planned) so I was stuck at home again.",0
3550,relationships,"I got pregnant, we got married.",0
3551,relationships,I sat her down and told her that she is ruining her chances of having a relationship with my husband by how strong she is coming on.,0
3552,relationships,I told her that she is pushing him away and making him uncomfortable.,0
3553,relationships,"She seemed to take that to heart but then days later said, “this is just who I am.”  I've been working on ways to fix this; it just isn’t very successful.",0
3554,relationships,I will take my mom to therapy with me when our schedules work.,0
3555,relationships,**TONIGHT:**,0
3556,relationships,She’s so sweet and gentle such that a complete stranger can reach into her mouth and take food away and she won’t even react.,0
3557,relationships,But she sometimes tries to grab food off the table if people aren’t around.,0
3558,relationships,MIL has been with us for several months now and tells us she loves spending time with the baby.,0
3559,relationships,She has her own room.,0
3560,relationships,I cook all the meals and my wife does most of the laundry.,0
3561,relationships,"I went on a week long Mexico vacation with my BF of 5 months, and she tried to sit me down and have a conversation about how if I got pregnant I would ruin my life (I had to teach myself all about those things because she preferred to ignore it, it's a good thing I enjoy research).",0
3562,relationships,"Now that I've decided to move in with my BF when I move back to my hometown, I don't even know how or when I should bring this one up.",0
3563,relationships,A little information on my own thought process and my relationship.,0
3564,relationships,"I am a very pragmatic person, but also very independent.",0
3565,relationships,"They're all things I enjoy doing and don't see as being that big of a deal, but she seems to perceive them as grand gestures.",0
3566,relationships,"She regularly says that she ""doesn't deserve"" someone as ""perfect"" as me (which yes, she does, she's amazing, and also I'm not even that great, just moderately thoughtful) and has also said that ""because of past experiences, I have trouble liking people who I know like me...",0
3567,relationships,"I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've ""earned"" the validation.""",0
3568,relationships,"In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her).",0
3569,relationships,"All of this makes me ambivalent about broaching the topic of a committed relationship with her because I don't know how she'll react, but at this point we've both admitted we're falling for each other.",0
3570,relationships,"l asked if there was someone else and she said ""no, even if there was we weren't in a relationship"".",0
3571,relationships,"Fast forward 3 months and I'm finally over her and life is going great, then I got a text from her and we started talking again.",0
3572,relationships,"During the holidays I returned to my country and I spent all month with her, this time officially dating.",0
3573,relationships,"We always kept our relationship open, so we jokingly spoke about one night stands and if we had any during those 3 months apart.",0
3574,relationships,We both mentioned that we had one - after we stopped talking.,0
3575,relationships,She embarrass him in front of others.,0
3576,relationships,Last weekend was really what made me decide to write this.,0
3577,relationships,"Jay, Marie, me and the husband were at another couples house.",0
3578,relationships,We were drinking and playing board games but Jay had to work the next day so he stopped early.,0
3579,relationships,Marie starts taking this personally for some reason and then says to all of us that he’s “always ruining her nights out”.,0
3580,relationships,I’d like to be married before we are pregnant.,0
3581,relationships,I’m not willing to compromise on that.,0
3582,relationships,Anyone been in a similar situation?,0
3583,relationships,Advice on how to proceed?,0
3584,relationships,I'll try to keep this short and succint so it's easier to read.,0
3585,relationships,I had a very brief relationship with this girl.,0
3586,relationships,We both conected inmediately and tried to be in a relationship.,0
3587,relationships,We both had problems that consumed us: she was bulimic and I had erections issues; we both had parent issues and a nihilistic aproach to life.,0
3588,relationships,"I wasn't a (mentally) strong boy, I was very immature and naive, I suppose she was kind of the same.",0
3589,relationships,"Picked music up again and I'm considering the possibility of doing it for the rest of my life rather than science, which is what I've been led by my environment to believe is my ""destiny.""",0
3590,relationships,I think so.,0
3591,relationships,It’s like hes expecting my tummy is spilling over my jeans like a muffin(it’s not) I’m still a size small instead of an Xsmall like I used to be when 14 but that’s pretty fucking normal I reckon.its like god help me if I’m a medium right?,0
3592,relationships,"Today I lashed out at him by saying omg dad it’s cuz I’m wearing these pants today ( the pants which are wide, loos high waisted and make ass look bigger), instead of skinny jeans so I obv gained like 10 pounds or tonnes of kilos or whatever overnight.",0
3593,relationships,"Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle, it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me, he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore.",0
3594,relationships,Anyway this part isn’t relevant to my relationship but I’d like to share anyway.,0
3595,relationships,Clearly what i need to do is just talk to her about it.,0
3596,relationships,I have a couple of examples in mind that will drive the point home.,0
3597,relationships,Mainly the first night i was introduced to everyone and a house warming we went to.,0
3598,relationships,We're having dinner tomorrow night.,0
3599,relationships,Thanks a ton for the feedback everyone.,0
3600,relationships,Also deflects my attempts at flirting.,0
3601,relationships,"I have always told her that if there’s anything she wants to know, no matter how uncomfortable it may be, that I’d tell her I the truth and in return that she would do the same.",0
3602,relationships,I repeatedly gave warning that I didn’t think it would help and that it was a bad idea.,0
3603,relationships,She said she had to know and I told her that I would but she couldn’t turn it into an issue because this all happened before I even knew her.,0
3604,relationships,She agreed.,0
3605,relationships,"This week, we stayed in the same house and I slept with her.",0
3606,relationships,We were watching a movie when she went to go to sleep in the next room (she's very tired a lot).,0
3607,relationships,"About an hour later, I heard her crying uncontrollably and shaking and screaming.",0
3608,relationships,It was really hard to see.,0
3609,relationships,"I held her until she went back to sleep, and then stayed with her.",0
3610,relationships,We broke up a month ago because the distance made us miserable.,0
3611,relationships,"We had only been doing long distance for 3-ish months, which is not long at all, but we had been dating before that for roughly 3 years, with a short break in between.",0
3612,relationships,I'm taking a gap year so I've been bouncing from place to place & my parents are so protective that they don't let me visit friends at college often (especially not her since they are suspicious of our relationship anyway [homophobia lol]).,0
3613,relationships,"I did visit her once, but only for a few days and she visited me in return.",0
3614,relationships,"Anyway, we both couldn't commit to a strict schedule of meeting up because of school, parents, money...",0
3615,relationships,I went on a holiday with my best friend [26M] and husband [26M].,0
3616,relationships,My husband and I have been together for ten years (married for six).,0
3617,relationships,"My best friend and I have known each other for three years, and spend a huge amount of time chatting with each other on the internet.",0
3618,relationships,"I love him to death, and he makes me insanely happy.",0
3619,relationships,"My friend lives decently far away, so we don't see each other often.",0
3620,relationships,Meet with her today and express this is a concern for me.,0
3621,relationships,"She says she doesn't see what the big deal is, people make mistakes and forget things.",0
3622,relationships,I agree and tell her they often forget what they don't care about.,0
3623,relationships,"She doesn't agree, we talk about it.",0
3624,relationships,She feels I am being very black and white in my thinking.,0
3625,relationships,The gist of the comments received was the K isn't going to change and I should get B to go to counselling to help her with her self-esteem and give her some outside input.,0
3626,relationships,"Of course, now K is having an online ""role playing relationship"" with some lady on Grand Theft Auto RP.",0
3627,relationships,B is helping him court her.,0
3628,relationships,She is presenting it as she is okay with this.,0
3629,relationships,"Listen, I've known B since high school, I've known her longer then my brother.",0
3630,relationships,Haven't felt this excited about someone since my ex from over five months ago.,0
3631,relationships,"This guy, J, and I met on Bumble.",0
3632,relationships,"I haven't even met him yet, but we have spent hours chatting on the phone and laughing.",0
3633,relationships,It all feels really effortless.,0
3634,relationships,I've dated a lot since the break up and no one has clicked with me like he has.,0
3635,relationships,They actually skyped on New Years (mostly for the sake of his Grandmother (his father’s mother) who he has a positive relationship with but somehow they are friends??),0
3636,relationships,"Anyways--- **MY MOTHER:** My mother, is a self-proclaimed ""Jewish mother"".",0
3637,relationships,"She subscribes to all the stereotypes and upholds them, and is disgustingly proud of it.",0
3638,relationships,"I basically said the same back, because it's true.",0
3639,relationships,The following days and weeks we kept hanging out occasionally and stayed in touch when she wasnt at BF in other city.,0
3640,relationships,"Than randomly, out of nowhere, no response... Few days , weeks, and now about 2 months.",0
3641,relationships,I called texted for about the first 2 weeks to see what was going on.,0
3642,relationships,Than just stopped trying.,0
3643,relationships,"Sorry, this will probably be a little long.",0
3644,relationships,"So, I broke up with my boyfriend of over a year early last month, and it's been... rough.",0
3645,relationships,"Half the time, I don't even know why we broke up.",0
3646,relationships,I thought our breakup was mutual.,0
3647,relationships,"She told me she was excited, I was just more enthusiastic about it.",0
3648,relationships,"I let it go, and we went out with friends for new years.",0
3649,relationships,I still felt this distance.,0
3650,relationships,"New years morning we woke up, I rolled over and told her that I wanted 2018 to be the year we really focus on us, that I was excited to keep working on getting us to a good place.",0
3651,relationships,She didn't seem to care.,0
3652,relationships,So here’s he thing.,0
3653,relationships,I do have feelings for him.,0
3654,relationships,They just aren’t the intensity level I’m used to feeling when I fall for some one.,0
3655,relationships,I normally have this sense of urgency.,0
3656,relationships,Its this “Crazy about you/can’t live with out you” type feeling.,0
3657,relationships,"When she got angry she also insults me for that, that she can never forgive me that ive done this at this time.",0
3658,relationships,2 minutes later she apoligizes for saying that.,0
3659,relationships,"She also said that we may not be sexually compatible, and that its unfair on me if I stay with her and put up with it.",0
3660,relationships,I obviously told her I don't want to break up and she doesn't either.,0
3661,relationships,I offered her time alone and she was so unsure in herself that she didn't even know if she wanted to take me up on the offer.,0
3662,relationships,"I said that I think we should wait until your appointment in March to freeze your ectropion, to see if that improves your libido.",0
3663,relationships,We ended up crying and cuddling each other.,0
3664,relationships,We had a lot in common and I really liked her.,0
3665,relationships,Then I went back to my country for Christmas holidays and I got to see her.,0
3666,relationships,It was really amazing and honestly it was way better than we expected.,0
3667,relationships,"Anyway, she has good grades and she's going to apply to the US (probably the same university as mine or same city).",0
3668,relationships,But the problem is she will be there in fall 2019.,0
3669,relationships,"I'm 35,husband 37 I always thought it would be ideal to have two kids.. My husband was on board with the idea hypothetically but now that it's actually the time to execute he is totally opposed to the idea His reasons are 1) He feels we can't afford it...He earns pretty well but I don't at the time.",0
3670,relationships,So we won't be able to actually build up a major college fund for her---- I feel that she can always take a loan later but she really can't loan a sibling.,0
3671,relationships,"I am lazy, this I can attest to.",0
3672,relationships,"She brings up the Christmas tree, and how we haven't taken it down yet.",0
3673,relationships,"I just stand in silence from her barrage, then take a bite of my sandwich.",0

3690,relationships,She mentioned how she helped him get through suicide and that he was a really good person.,0
3691,relationships,"I told him if he’s not careful, all this attention could make her fall in love with him.",0
3692,relationships,"For a while, I noticed the behavior stopped.",0
3693,relationships,"He wouldn’t stay up as late, they stopped working out for a little bit, the glances and flirting stopped, and I noticed they weren’t talking as much, because they both talked to me more.",0
3694,relationships,"However, recently it has started back up again, and almost as strongly as before.",0
3695,relationships,"They do all the same things again, and they are always making eye contact with eachother or teasing and flirting.",0

3702,relationships,I’m totally open to him being part of the child’s life if he wants.,0
3703,relationships,I know he would be a good dad despite him turning out to be a terrible husband Thanks for the advice guys.,0
3704,relationships,"At times, he would get stalker-ish, and she would remove him from her contacts.",0
3705,relationships,"This would infuriate him, and he would create an alternate character to threaten her, saying how he is going to find her, kill her, and tell me about their relationship.",0
3706,relationships,"Being scared, my wife would add him back, pretend to be friends, only to repeat this cycle over several times over the next few years.",0

3709,relationships,"She'll order so much food, and binges on it, while downing shots the whole time.",0
3710,relationships,The way she orders food and drinks kinda makes me change my eating and drinking habits when I'm with her.,0

3712,relationships,She always excuses herself to the bathroom right after a meal and I know she's purging.,0
3713,relationships,"The more recent time I hung out with her, I put my foot down a little more and told her i didn't want to pay for so much food, and that I wasn't doing shots (I never do shots, but she always orders them for me when I'm out with her and then is really manipulative in order to pressure me to do them).",0
3714,relationships,Everything was absolutely perfect.,0
3715,relationships,"He is always very quiet, but is a complete sweetheart, and very warm and kind once he trusts someone.",0
3716,relationships,He’s pretty much the spitting image of what I imagined of the person I would marry when I was young.,0
3717,relationships,The one thing about him that would have seemed “off” is that he never really talked at all about his life before the Army.,0
3718,relationships,"I know what city he is from, and a couple inconsequential details, but nothing significant.",0
3719,relationships,My sister lives with her BF and my 2 year old nephew about 30 minutes away from me.,0

3722,relationships,I live in 500 sqft a studio but I have a pullout couch in addition to my bed.,0
3723,relationships,I've been with my BF for 3 years and about 5 months ago he unofficially moved in with me (unofficial because we share bills and all of his stuff is here but his mail and whatnot still goes to his parents where he was living before).,0

3736,relationships,"Sunday morning I climb out of bed and start breakfast, and she said “Too bad you were asleep this morning, I tried to wake you up for something special...” Later that day we were getting ready for a birthday party, and she said, “I wish we could be undressing instead, but we got a party to go to...” I took that as a hint that later tonight she’ll finally be in the mood.",0
3737,relationships,"If she were honest or apologetic, I could try to understand.",0
3738,relationships,But is that naive?,0

3802,relationships,I would never think of having a talk like that with my ex and not telling my GF.,0

3806,relationships,FH is her youngest and always around when she has 'flares'.,0

3821,relationships,Could it be because i have no one here and i found comfort with him to be the reason i developed feelings for him?,0

3842,relationships,"Lisa was the only person in my inner circle of friends to have a poor reaction when I told her I was dating another woman, which was shocking to me because I trusted her, and because she often used social media to convey her allyship with the LGBT community.",0
3843,relationships,"She often told me that as soon as I met my gf, I quit talking to her (Lisa).",0
3844,relationships,"As my relationship with my gf became more serious, Lisa and I became even more distant from each other, and she would often ignore my texts or emails (neither of us were ever much for talking on the phone).",0
3845,relationships,"I don't feel at all like he doesn't like me or has gone off me, we meet once a week and 'chat' daily but I'm kind of unhappy I'm not getting the 'cant get enough of talking' experience that usually comes along with being enamoured at the start.",0
3846,relationships,"I nearly always reply within 20 mins if I'm not busy because I'm still in the excited pahse, but I get a lot of 3/4 wait times with a read receipt, with him coming on and off whatsapp within that period before I get a reply.",0
3847,relationships,It hardly screams that he's really into me when he is ok to wait that long to reply.,0
3848,relationships,I assume he's messaging others so why not me?,0
3849,relationships,I'm his new potential gf!,0
3850,relationships,"Our sense of humor is very similar.. She's gorgeous, funny, smart, and likes some of the same things I do.. She's wifey material..",0

3926,relationships,"These are some of the bigger events that have pissed me off; however, they have the same fight everyday regarding their differing values, and her wanting to do things/live her life and him refusing to make any sort of sacrifice or compromise to do that with her, resulting in her just settling to the situation.",0

3939,relationships,At the time of this post it has been 7 years on going and had faced innumerous delays.,0
3940,relationships,"The biggest restrictions was of course money, my father-in-law refused to get any contractors, in the belief they were too expensive and wouldn't do the job to the standard he wanted, he also sourced all the materials from back yard sales and contacts.",0

3963,relationships,She called me the next day and was so grateful and loved them.,0
3964,relationships,I was complementary of her and she ate it up and asked me in a non-guilty (more of an “I love how you are to me” way) why I’m so sweet to her.,0
3965,relationships,I work with her sister.,0
3966,relationships,Her sister got me this great job at our firm after I was introduced through a mutual friend and hit it off.,0

3971,relationships,"A few months after starting classes, my buddy told me that Chloe has a  crush on me, and gave me the impression that she wanted me to be aware of this, however, even after that, she didn’t try to talk to me or make herself noticed at all.",0

3980,relationships,"Second time, he first asked for a ""break,"" then, unsurprisingly, ended if for good.",0
3981,relationships,"A month or two after that we met up again, he said he wanted to get back together, then the next time told me it would never happen.",0
3982,relationships,"Not even three weeks ago, he messages me again asking to meet up, and me thinking with my heart not my head, said yes.",0
3983,relationships,"I knew I wanted to only maybe be friends, and take it slow to see what happened.",0
3984,relationships,PS: I forgot to mention and I don't know where to put this back so here it goes.,0
3985,relationships,"Her parents have 2 big houses, I live in a 1 room small apartment.",0

3987,relationships,We were planing to move before Christmas but I put all on hold for her thesis so she could focus on that.,0
3988,relationships,She said plenty of times that my apartment was a big issue for her because it was so small and that when we moved to her parent's 2nd house we would have a great improvement in our relationship and our life.,0
3989,relationships,"And enjoy this day of the miracle that is being above-ground, breathing the air, and feeling the world around you.",0

3993,relationships,However 4 months ago I moved to a different country for education.,0
3994,relationships,"We met a handful number of times before I left and they weren’t dates exactly, just as best friends.",0
3995,relationships,After I got here (foreign country) we have been speaking almost daily on the phone and gotten even more closer.,0
3996,relationships,We recently started dropping hints to each other that we like each other and finally decided to discuss what we feel.,0
3997,relationships,She told me she loves me and wants a relationship.,0
3998,relationships,I have to first start off by saying my voice is not high-pitched.,0
3999,relationships,"My inflection occasionally goes up, especially if I'm excited about something.",0
4000,relationships,"I'm sort of expressive with my hands while talking, though I don't think more than anyone else, male or female.",0
4001,relationships,She tells me this is the only thing that is making her doubt our relationship.,0
4002,relationships,A little background: this has been an issue with her for her last several boyfriends.,0
4003,relationships,(I really did).,0
4004,relationships,"If she needed space to do homework, thats perfectly fine.",0
4005,relationships,I did my best to assuage her anxiety.,0
4006,relationships,"So we'd postpone another week, another day... only, either the night before or the morning of, she'd cancel me visiting again... again.. and again... That put a little strain on our relationship, we wanted to see each other.",0
4007,relationships,"I have no problem with a few years either way, hell the last girl I dated was 6 years younger, but this is an entire decade.",0
4008,relationships,That's a lot.,0
4009,relationships,But other than the number itself I don't know if I should care this much or not.,0
4010,relationships,She's pretty mature for her age and I'm admitedly a bit of a late bloomer so we are in roughly the same stage of life so that's not an issue like in a lot of age differential cases.,0
4011,relationships,She never really felt the need to do that and occasionally would go out with her friends.,0
4012,relationships,"Everything was great -- I took care of her extremely well, she took care of me patiently and amazingly.",0
4013,relationships,"I bought her a car, paid for her rent, and ultimately supported her so she could focus and finish her college (I'm full time employed, the breadwinner in the relationship).",0
4014,relationships,Our relationship was VIVID and full of color in the beginning.,0
4015,relationships,"We had our own apartment, got a beautiful dog together, and traveled to a few places.",0
4016,relationships,"Many of my cohorts asked me ""how are you two even friends?""",0
4017,relationships,when he came to which I couldn't give a clear answer.,0
4018,relationships,"So in short, we have a business license and agreement we both signed.",0
4019,relationships,"We were friends, but I think time has changed him and I and I don't think we would be friends if we met today.",0
4020,relationships,"He isn't productive for the business and his practices many times seems to include emotion and his own self interests rather than the business, so I find him unfit as a business partner as well.",0
4021,relationships,She works 6 days a week and usually ends her work day around 9-10pm.,0
4022,relationships,I work from 9-5pm.,0
4023,relationships,"She lives across the city, 45 minutes away from me.",0
4024,relationships,"When she works, we can hardly meet.",0
4025,relationships,"So when we do make plans to meet, I extremely value those time.",0
4026,relationships,I realized that maybe it's better if we break up even though I love him so much and he's one of the most important people in my life.,0
4027,relationships,"If we werent together for so long, I'd probably would've just blocked him already and carry on.",0
4028,relationships,But I don't want that.,0
4029,relationships,I want to keep being friends.,0
4030,relationships,**Tl;dr: Thinking my 2 friends who broke-up are soulmates but may be both heading for a second-best option.,0

4033,relationships,"For 10 years, they were the best couple I know, not fighting, respecting each other greatly and having a ""higher"" connection.",0
4034,relationships,"Hey, I (m, 18) don't know, what I should do, about my brother.",0
4035,relationships,"Apart from many different things that are bothering me about him this one is at the moment a big problem, because I often have people here at my house: He doesn't clean the bathroom, which means he doesn't flush the toilet, pees on the ground, leaves sometimes condoms laying around etc.",0
4036,relationships,Sometimes one a week on the weekend.,0
4037,relationships,This worked greated.,0
4038,relationships,Until late june.,0
4039,relationships,She started to cancel my visits to see her.,0
4040,relationships,"Asking if I was mad, when I constantly told her I supported everything she needed to do to succeed.",0
4041,relationships,I tried to reply to most but I think I'd like to forget about this post for a bit and move on.,0
4042,relationships,So I'm going to stop replying.,0

4048,relationships,IDK.,0
4049,relationships,I've applied to anything I can think of and have had no luck.,0
4050,relationships,"And for the people who implied I have no ""market value"" to him, my divorce was because my ex cheated.",0
4051,relationships,"Plus, we’re using his car, which will eventually result in the usual wear and tear and expenses.",0
4052,relationships,"We equally split all shared expenses like gas, food, rent, and bills, but we both have the same salary and similar assets.",0
4053,relationships,"Do any cohabiting couples pool and split their commuting expenses equally, or do you just chalk it up to a difference in individual expenses and each pay your own way?",0
4054,relationships,tl;dr : My boyfriend's commute is twice as expensive as mine and it doesn't really seem fair.,0
4055,relationships,Should we split it?,0
4056,relationships,We set our wedding date last August for July 15th.,0
4057,relationships,We specifically picked this date after looking at the average temperatures for that date for the last 5 years.,0
4058,relationships,"We determined the highs were about 7 degrees cooler than the following weekends in July, so we went with the 15th.",0
4059,relationships,"Wouldn’t you know it, but my FMIL booked their family vacation for July.",0
4060,relationships,One night after going to a club we go back to our friends and we snuggle next to each other.,0
4061,relationships,She interlocks her fingers into my hand and later on in the night turns around and kisses me.,0
4062,relationships,We kiss for the whole night.,0
4063,relationships,We couldn't do anything more because our friends were sleeping in the same room.,0
4064,relationships,We didn't talk about that night until a few weeks later when we went to a bar together.,0
4065,relationships,"Since then I´ve met some ""wrong ones""- I mean guys who lied to me, for example this guy who was trying to convince me that he loves me and wants only me and I found out that he´s been dating a girl since 2014 and that they´re expecting a baby.",0
4066,relationships,"So yeah after these few ""mistakes"", I started having trust issues.",0
4067,relationships,"I just couldn´t trust guys, every time I met someone I couldn´t trust him and couldn´t stop expecting something bad coming.",0
4068,relationships,In December last year the best thing in my life happened to me.,0
4069,relationships,"I´ve met a guy, and he´s #EverythingGoals.",0
4070,relationships,So we were talking about it and she wouldn't budge again.,0
4071,relationships,"The conversation started to heat up, nothing I said was enough, that we would buy something, that I would cook with her, that we could go 1 day earlier and cook at my grandma's, nothing.",0
4072,relationships,She pushed me to the edge again until I lost it and ended the argue saying that she mustn't go this year with me.,0
4073,relationships,"That she must stay with her family, that I didn't want her to go with my family so she wouldn't have to worry anymore.",0
4074,relationships,She calmed down and we got to sleep.,0
4075,relationships,* Is this a lack of clear communication?,0
4076,relationships,(By either one party or both) * Should I try to get back in touch with them?,0
4077,relationships,Thank you if you made it this far.,0
4078,relationships,"Through my interactions with him, I have gotten the hint that Jack is interested in me, in a more-than-friends kind of way.",0
4079,relationships,I don't want to assume this as a fact—it's certainly possible that he is just trying to make a new friend.,0
4080,relationships,"Along with many small hints that he *is* interested in me, however, the biggest hint is probably whenever I mention my boyfriend.",0
4081,relationships,"I have a boyfriend of about a year, and whenever I do mention him, Jack seems very visibly uncomfortable.",0
4082,relationships,Good goals - She finished undergrad and already wants to go back to school.,0
4083,relationships,I value girls who want to get a good education or pursue entrepreneurship.,0
4084,relationships,"Doesn't ask me for much - Given my financial situation, she hasn't asked me to do something that was out of my budget.",0
4085,relationships,I'm asking this because most of the girls I've met aren't like her.,0
4086,relationships,I will not be sharing my credit details.,0
4087,relationships,"Though hard, I will end my friendship with her.",0
4088,relationships,Might think about it if she apologizes but am not sure at this moment.,0
4089,relationships,I will cherish connections with more on my other friends who were super nice to let me know what's happening at home.,0
4090,relationships,"So the now: we had been commiserating for a while about our shitty exes and stress, and about 3 weeks ago I was on a date and realized I would have rather just spent the night with her instead of the date.",0
4091,relationships,A couple days later while having some drinks and de-stressing I kissed her.,0
4092,relationships,She kissed me back.,0
4093,relationships,"We stopped before having sex and ended up meeting a couple days later where we both agreed to take things slow, in light of our most recent breakups.",0
4094,relationships,We ended up spending the next few nights together as she didn't want to be home around her ex and we just cuddled and would kiss but then stop before we had sex.,0
4095,relationships,And we end up spending an indefinitely long period of time together that just never seems like it will end.,0
4096,relationships,"I would really like to be able to hang out with her, like cook dinner, or go to a bar, or watch a movie, for example, and then just both go back to our individual homes and do our own thing.",0
4097,relationships,"But, that seems impossible.",0
4098,relationships,"I guess I’m really if it is necessary to constantly, physically, be with a S/O for a healthy relatioship to flourish?",0
4099,relationships,"I was home for winter break, and I didn't see him at all during that time.",0
4100,relationships,"To clarify, I'm a goodie-two-shoes.",0
4101,relationships,"I never did anything ""bad"" until I was in my early teens.",0
4102,relationships,Be ready to contribute (reasonably).,0
4103,relationships,"B - Calmly, with neutral to negative vocabulary and intonation express dissatisfaction with certain behavior, action or outcome of action and politely ask not to repeat same behavior/action/make sure particular outcome doesn’t repeat again.",0
4104,relationships,Make sure message was audible and comprehended and if necessary still calmly repeat again Be ready for calm reasonable discussion in case of decline.,0
4105,relationships,"C - Harsh, sudden, loud expression of dissatisfaction.",0
4106,relationships,I suggested therapy but he's not in favour of it.,0
4107,relationships,"I think his father passing has also altered his reactions, which are out of whack now.",0
4108,relationships,"I was sick last week and was not in town - he let a couple of dishes fester in the sink, and I discovered when I got back that there was fungus on it.",0
4109,relationships,"When I'm single it's never an issue if a person I'm seeing is sleeping with others but as soon as I fall in love, I can get kind of possessive.",0
4110,relationships,My partner is very much the opposite.,0
4111,relationships,All of his relationships have been open and he's slept with pretty much all of his friends.,0
4112,relationships,Maybe a few months ago he told me that he'd really like it if I slept with other people.,0
4113,relationships,I was fairly keen but was getting weird gut fear at the thought of him sleeping with other people.,0
4114,relationships,"We kept in touch the entire time (and he'd always seem to want me desperately, even telling me things like ""I can't wait to see you as soon as I'm back"").",0
4115,relationships,"But when he got back, he didn't see me right away.",0
4116,relationships,"And despite my asking him a couple of times (like, two or three), we didn't see each other for nearly two months.",0
4117,relationships,"Eventually, I literally said ""So are we ever going to see each other again or is this just over?""",0
4118,relationships,"He responded by immediately asking me on a date for that week, at a nice French restaurant near his place.",0
4119,relationships,I could really use additional input on this because I'm not exactly sure what a healthy and compatible relationship looks like at this point.,0
4120,relationships,"When we try to go out and do things, we often do not have fun because our personalities clash.",0
4121,relationships,"Example of this, I wanted to go kayaking and was surprised that he said yes because he rarely wants to be outside.",0
4122,relationships,We get to the springs to kayak and I want to go in the water because I see no point in kayaking if you don't go in the water.,0
4123,relationships,He refuses because he hates water.,0
4124,relationships,Joe and Janet live in the big city a few hours away from the small town where they grew up.,0
4125,relationships,They came here for university and stayed.,0
4126,relationships,About half of Joe’s circle of friends is Janet’s friend circle including ex boyfriends and her college peers.,0
4127,relationships,The other half are bar friends.,0
4128,relationships,"And I also know this is not what my grandmother would have wanted (she was very traditional, and having her granddaughters as pallbearers would just be not her style).",0
4129,relationships,"Personally, I have nothing against changing traditions- I just can't do it.",0
4130,relationships,"On top of it, I was not asked if I would be a pallbearer, I just found out via my sister that I would be one.",0
4131,relationships,My Dad was planning on telling me when I got there for the visitation.,0
4132,relationships,Reactions form my family have been:,0
4133,relationships,"However, he seems to have quite few girl-friends and he is friendly with them, but not to this extend I would say.",0
4134,relationships,We have known each other for a month now and I wonder should I wait for him to make a move / should I completely leave it since he is coworker / or should I ask him out?,0
4135,relationships,"I am interested to get to know him and I dont have problem to ask him out casually, however, I dont want to rush things.",0
4136,relationships,"On the other hand, I dont want it to get too old and have lots of small talk and not really get to know each other.",0
4137,relationships,My husband (29m) and I (26f) live across the country from our parents and have been there almost two years now.,0
4138,relationships,"I don't really have a relationship with my inlaws (mf 65ish) (ie they never reach out to me expect for once to ask what to get my husband for his birthday and rarely talk to my husband, they don't ask about me or don't seem interest when I'm brought up) and it doesn't bug me because they are incredibly negative and angry people.",0
4139,relationships,"I don't want to get into every story, and man do I have some stories, but i guess it's important to know that I've been warned about their general attitude and behavior from others and everyone who has met them that I'm friends or family with has agreed with me that their son is the source of their happiness and they feed off of each others negativity.",0
4140,relationships,"However, they've never been out rightly malicious towards me.",0
4141,relationships,I got a fair amount of interest on Facebook (though og course a lot of people didn’t follow through) one lady (F 40’s or early 50’s) liked my post and sent a friend request.,0
4142,relationships,I accepted even though I don’t know her because I thought she might be interested in the team.,0
4143,relationships,It turns out she is very well connected in the horse word here and knows a lot of people I know (and seems very popular).,0
4144,relationships,"Well, fast forward to now and this woman has posted all over about her starting an adult drill team.",0
4145,relationships,"Her team is within 20 minutes of where my drill team would be, and so all the people who were interested in mine seem to have gone to hers (I think because she’s a connected horse person here).",0
4146,relationships,I'm dating her for more than one year now and everything seems fine.,0
4147,relationships,"She's loving, she's caring and so am I. I know she truly loves me and I also loves her.",0
4148,relationships,"However, although all of this, some thoughts keep coming at me.",0
4149,relationships,I'll try to focus on these problems below in a objective manner.,0
4150,relationships,**The I want to see other girls problem**.,0
4151,relationships,"Sports teams, mostly, and some TV shows.",0
4152,relationships,He also enjoys a wide range of video games.,0
4153,relationships,"The problem is that I really, truly don't have anything in common with him.",0
4154,relationships,"I don't know shit about sports, I'm not really much of a TV-watcher and I'm not a huge gamer at all.",0
4155,relationships,I have some favorite shows but none of them are really that similar to those that Jack likes.,0
4156,relationships,Two years ago we moved to a different city for his work.,0
4157,relationships,"He earns a lot more than me and his job offers a lot more career progression, so I wanted to support him.",0
4158,relationships,"I’ve always thought we were a good team, there have been times where he’s struggled financially and I’ve helped him out no question.",0
4159,relationships,"We talked about the extra money he’d be able to save by walking to work (2 mins away,) and it seemed as though we were on the same page for what we wanted in the future; buy our own place, a car and start a family.",0
4160,relationships,So I thought all was on the right track.,0
4161,relationships,"They have two children together, Anna and a planned child, Grace.",0
4162,relationships,My uncle has 5 other children with 3 other women.,0
4163,relationships,"Grace is two years old, and I used to watch both Grace and Anna.",0
4164,relationships,"When Grace was born, my family was careful to give Anna more attention.",0
4165,relationships,"Anna is extremely, extremely obsessed with her little sister.",0
4166,relationships,"Then, the issue was that she was too dehydrated for a blood draw and the mental health hospital wouldn't take her without the draw.",0
4167,relationships,"So, I had to take her home and pump her full of water and food and cross our fingers that she could get a draw in the morning.",0
4168,relationships,"By morning, the bed had filled.",0
4169,relationships,"So, the counselor and I took her to the Emergency room to see if they could admit her at the local hospital.",0
4170,relationships,"There, she absolutely *refused* to have her blood drawn and the ER told me that they were just going to have to discharge her if they couldn't get the tests.",0
4171,relationships,"That night wasn’t so great for me as I felt ignored because both of the guys (my bf and the mutual friend) were mostly having conversations with her, leaving me to trail behind.",0
4172,relationships,"I thought maybe it’s because we were “hosting” her and because she’s on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to us - as in, she’s into things and engages in those things we’re not necessarily into, but are interested in and could hold a conversation about.",0
4173,relationships,"Anyway, over the course of our relationship my bf would still bring Sally up occasionally, how they were going to hang out with other coworkers.",0
4174,relationships,"Of course, I’m totally okay with that and I encourage him to be social when he can!",0
4175,relationships,"I’ve met all of his friends and I always enjoy myself around them - except you know who, enter Sally *rolls eyes*.",0
4176,relationships,**tl;dr friend is struggling with alcoholism and bulimia.,0
4177,relationships,She's back in town and wants to hang out and eat and drink.,0
4178,relationships,How do I tell her that I will no longer participate in these activities with Her?,0
4179,relationships,I heard from a mutual friend that she got engaged and I’m truly happy for her and would like to wish her congratulations.,0
4180,relationships,Is it is selfish of me to apologize to her and say congrats or just wish her congrats?,0
4181,relationships,Additional info: my sister was also her BFF and after I ghosted her they had a huge dramatic falling out after my sister tried to keep the peace.,0
4182,relationships,"I don't think it would be different in another relationship, and I think both of us accept that we have sexual hangups.",0
4183,relationships,But I always wonder if I would be more sexually passionate in a different relationship.,0
4184,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Do men just inherently look at the greener grass, or does a good relationship make you feel settled and satisfied?",0
4185,relationships,"And please don't say ""open relationship"" as the answer...",0
4186,relationships,"OK, so as the title says my sister has been trying to set me up with her friend for a couple of months now.",0
4187,relationships,Up til recently I refused to even entertain the idea because she is slightly over a full decade younger than me.,0
4188,relationships,"My sister thinks I'm being stupid letting the age difference make my mind up for me, to the point where we had a huge fight at Christmas about it but I refused to budge.",0
4189,relationships,"Recently however she's been bringing her friend around a lot (me, my sister, and her husband all get along really well so we hang out at least 2 or 3 weekends a month usually) and as I get to know this girl I am realizing why my sister has been so adamant about it.",0
4190,relationships,It's almost eerie how much we have in common.,0
4191,relationships,Though we both had crushes on each other we weren't sure if the feelings were reciprocated.,0
4192,relationships,"She also has some self esteem issues and told me that she wasn't ready to date someone like me three years ago when we first met, because I was ""too intimidating"", but instead ""settled"" for her ex.",0
4193,relationships,"She dated that ex for two years, but never seemed that interested in him.",0
4194,relationships,She would complain about feeling like a caregiver for him (he was seriously depressed to the point where she had to make doctor appointments for him) and always talked about wanting to be with someone who was more independent and had their life together.,0
4195,relationships,"As her friend I remember her saying she felt like he was good for her at the moment, but that she knew it wouldn't last forever (side note: she was open about her feelings with him, and he agreed to just enjoy things in the moment, though I'm sure he was secretly hopeful she would change her mind).",0
4196,relationships,I'm going to keep this story short.,0
4197,relationships,"I'm (16M) openly gay, he (16M) isn't.",0
4198,relationships,We've been friends and somewhat more for 5 months.,0
4199,relationships,"He hates affection and being touched, but he constantly flirts with me, touches me, wants me to massage his ""sore"" back, wants me to sleep beside him, he cuddles me in his ""sleep""(which he has now revealed to be a fake slumber), and he always asks me about being gay and he truly is trying to understand it.",0
4200,relationships,"Even if anything really happened between us, I wouldn't be getting a fulfilling relationship.",0
4201,relationships,"Back to my dad, during lunch he wanted to say some words to my GF, to encourage her to keep studying the doctorate, he said that if she felt that money was an issue, that don't let her that take her down, that doctorates in our country earn very poorly but that getting that degree would open doors to work abroad and land a job she would love.",0
4202,relationships,"You see, my dad didn't know (well, I've told him plenty of times, but I figured he forgot at the time) that my GF's mom was a doctorate.",0
4203,relationships,"My GF's mom openly told in front of my that she didn't earn enough for the years of study and work she did, everybody in our country knows that doctorates don't earn enough money for the effort, capacity and dedication they're required to do/have.",0
4204,relationships,"But when my dad said those words, nobody said anything.",0
4205,relationships,I didn't take it as offensive.,0
4206,relationships,"Been together for 5 years, married for 1 year.",0
4207,relationships,My husband outwardly reserved/introverted but he's also very goofy around me.,0
4208,relationships,We joke around and are playful with each other in most interactions unless it comes to serious subjects.,0
4209,relationships,"Lots of teasing, tickling, and 'play wrestling' in our home.",0
4210,relationships,"The problem has always been when it comes to, umm, being romantic.",0
4211,relationships,So I met this guy about 9 months ago at a meet-up group.,0
4212,relationships,We used to go out for drinks every other weekend and he'd always come on to me.,0
4213,relationships,We ended up hooking up a few times when drunk and became sort-of friends w/ benefits.,0
4214,relationships,It was the first time I'd done anything like that but he seemed like a natural flirter.,0
4215,relationships,"But after a while, some personal stuff got in the way of his life and he took a break from the drinking/partying etc.",0
4216,relationships,I want to start off by saying I love my in laws.,0
4217,relationships,They do a LOT for us and we are incredibly grateful for them.,0
4218,relationships,"My MIL has always been around to babysit when I’ve needed to go to doctors appts, and seeing that she has MS (not severe), my SIL comes over to help play/do the lifting.",0
4219,relationships,"My mil is capable of all of that, but she has a harder time.",0
4220,relationships,We have a history with my SIL.,0
4221,relationships,We went from completely being strangers to being absolutely the best of friends.,0
4222,relationships,"And im talking about a person who says the same things at the same time, perfectly understands your point, same faith, same songs you listen to, just so much coincidence happening during those 8 months that made me believe in fate, destiny - whatever you call it.",0
4223,relationships,"And im 28, i've had 2 exes.",0
4224,relationships,Both long term.,0
4225,relationships,Ive never been single since I was 17.,0
4226,relationships,"We met and it went really well - he's a super sweet, smart, and thoughtful kid (just like his dad).",0
4227,relationships,"It turns out that the kid has (VERY recently - after I met his dad) been dealing with some mental health issues - he texted a friend that he was suicidal, and his parents have been scrambling to get him help because they are not sure if he has depression or something else.",0
4228,relationships,He's since started therapy and seems to be doing ok but obviously they are very concerned.,0
4229,relationships,I listened and was very supportive when he told me (I've dealt with my fair share of mentally ill family members) and I could tell he really appreciated it.,0
4230,relationships,We talked about it a few more times after that day.,0
4231,relationships,I moved out of our family home and in with my boyfriend nearly 2 years ago.,0
4232,relationships,"Since then we’d speak a bit over text, mainly for each others birthdays.",0
4233,relationships,Last time we spoke via text was about three months ago.,0
4234,relationships,I asked Eva if she wanted tickets to a concert for a band that we both really like and had seen in concert together before.,0
4235,relationships,"She said yeah, but was less than enthusiastic when I gave her the ticket a week later when I went to visit.",0
4236,relationships,I've been dating this guy for nearly three months.,0
4237,relationships,"We met at a bar and had a one night stand, so my expectations were very low.",0
4238,relationships,We started by taking it slow (dinner or takeout and a movie on Saturdays) but things felt really nice and normal.,0
4239,relationships,I'm used to meeting guys on apps where everything is a game and usually they are dating multiple people at once; this felt different.,0
4240,relationships,We met before Thanksgiving and managed to keep the momentum going through a lot of travel and three weeks spent apart.,0
4241,relationships,As someone in there house is no longer going to be living with them as a mutual agreement.,0
4242,relationships,I get along really well with some people in this agreed group and they are far more enthusiastic and keen than the others I mentioned above.,0
4243,relationships,I discussed with this group prior to the free slot that it would be lovely to live with them if possible and now that they have a slot it's actually possible.,0
4244,relationships,Since that happened I agreed to live take the slot with them.,0
4245,relationships,Having a house with them (five of us total) and I think it's in my best interest as they are a tight friend group meaning communication to sort it out is easier and they're more assertive - four of them are also taking the same subject as me.,0
4246,relationships,"I meet a great guy, we connect immediately due to same interests.",0
4247,relationships,"I like him a lot, he likes me too.",0
4248,relationships,"We go on a few dates, everything goes smoothly - the conversation is still heated, the guy still shows enthusiasm regarding going out with me or me in general.",0
4249,relationships,"After a few dates, we end up either having sex or doing something sexual, and then it all cools down.",0
4250,relationships,The conversations go at a much slower pace up to the point where we stop talking at all.,0
4251,relationships,Neither did I.,0
4252,relationships,"This turned to weeks, months and before I knew it it was a year.",0
4253,relationships,I was bitter.,0
4254,relationships,I never received an apology and felt no consideration for my feelings regarding anything was there.,0
4255,relationships,I get confused sometimes as to why in my teen years I was okay with talking to her.,0
4256,relationships,She's okay if you say a rude joke back though so she can take it too.,0
4257,relationships,"She pokes fun at my lifestyle (I count calories by weighing things in grams, get my eyebrows waxed, go to the gym 5 days a week and jogging 1 day no matter the weather).",0
4258,relationships,"She is also way ahead in school, and will have a bachelor's at 19 from her university, while I am in my freshman year.",0
4259,relationships,"She also has a job in her field this year, she makes like $17 an hour and I work at a grocery store barely getting through freshman year while she's killing her senior classes.",0
4260,relationships,During our conversation about weird way girls have hit on me I asked about her and she listed way more weird guys than I had weird girls and I know she's hot and I know currently she has multiple offers to go Netflix and chill or go out (I've seen her open snapchats from these boys like over her shoulder while we've been hanging out).,0
4261,relationships,"Does he actually like me, or am I going to end up just hanging out with this guy?",0
4262,relationships,"He hasn't made a move yet, so I'm inclined to think the latter.",0
4263,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: I end up in confusing friendships with men that blur the lines between ""relationship"" and ""friendship.""",0
4264,relationships,"No we do not have sex everyday, yes we both work, no its not a problem of the change.",0
4265,relationships,"I should have said ""I'm usually successful 1 out of 4 times I attempt to initiate.""",0
4266,relationships,I just want to make sure that I am still crossing my i's and dotting my t's on my end or if I should ask her if there's any improvements I could make.,0
4267,relationships,---   **tl;dr**: Do most relationships die down in the bedroom after a while?,0
4268,relationships,"I mean that type of behavior is just weird, I don't understand how someone can still hang out with their friends every day almost like theyre in high school.",0
4269,relationships,His job is kind of low demand (bartender and has an internship at an office) so i guess he just has a lot of free time... but still.,0
4270,relationships,---   **tl;dr**: Boyfriend hangs out with his friends constantly and im worried this is a sign of immaturity.,0
4271,relationships,I had an anxiety attack.,0
4272,relationships,"When we returned home, I put my foot down.",0
4273,relationships,"I told him that his behavior towards me was unacceptable; above all, as my (then future) husband, he needed to put my comfort and well-being above all other considerations as I did with him.",0
4274,relationships,"He listening, apologized profusely, and we have not had any further issues with this.",0
4275,relationships,Until today.,0
4276,relationships,"So I pursued him, invited him to come out drinking with our friend group a couple times and slept with him early on.",0
4277,relationships,We continued sleeping with each other and I guess fell into a FWB situation (though he wanted us to be exclusive and we were).,0
4278,relationships,In the beginning it was mostly us going out to bars and me coming to his house to have sex.,0
4279,relationships,"We got on really well and it wasn't just a sex thing, but it seemed like it wasn't going to turn into a relationship and I was fine with that.",0
4280,relationships,Mostly because he didn't seem really concerned with it.,0
4281,relationships,A few weeks ago I found some notes of hers open at our computer.,0
4282,relationships,She had written questions to ask for a psychic reading or some such(she's into that stuff).,0
4283,relationships,"One of them was, ""is this guy worth pursuing?""",0
4284,relationships,"""This guy"" refers to an online friend from out of state she had been having extensive conversations with, which we had talked about not long before, and of course she labeled him as ""just a friend"", albeit him growing more and more fascinated with her.",0
4285,relationships,"I offered an open relationship, partly because I had entertained the idea before, but mostly to de-escalate what could be a relationship ending event.",0
4286,relationships,"He wasn't ambitious or motivated anymore, he was sad, depressed, always pessimistic and never really doing any work.",0
4287,relationships,"I ended up not only doing all development work, but also our social, PR and leg work as well here in NYC making relationships.",0
4288,relationships,Many times he has decided to hinder the business due to reasons related to what I mentioned.,0
4289,relationships,"For instance, one time we were creating an ad for a campaign we were running for the app.",0
4290,relationships,So I tried posting a similar post last week and had technical difficulties so here it goes.,0
4291,relationships,I think I’m going to do this chronologically— High school: I become close to someone who will become known as one of my best friends.,0
4292,relationships,Let’s call her Jessie.,0
4293,relationships,"I want to pursue a friendship because Jessie is a strong independent woman mature beyond her years, has a sassy Latina attitude, and we have the same sense of humor.",0
4294,relationships,"We've known each other for 9 years, were FWB for about 3 years, then moved into the committed monogamous relationship we're in now, and have been in for 2 years.",0
4295,relationships,"I've really enjoyed everything about our relationship, as she's taught me more than anyone ever has, and has been the best at putting up with any and all things that have come up.",0
4296,relationships,"About halfway through the first year, she began asking if I'd ever be okay with her experimenting with a girl, or if I'd ever consider her having other sex friends.",0
4297,relationships,"She doesn't want serious relationships with them, she only wants to bang.",0
4298,relationships,"Having never been asked that in any of my previous relationships, I told her I wasn't sure and that were I ever 100% on board with that idea, I'd let her know.",0
4299,relationships,She used the money from her moms house to buy her own.,0
4300,relationships,"That was a couple weeks in a hotel, but we thought it was strong of her to be able to leave her abusive husband, and purchase a house so quickly.",0
4301,relationships,"BACKSTORY LEADING TO: Right about 3 months ago, my petty cash came up missing ($200.00).",0
4302,relationships,I reported it immediately.,0
4303,relationships,"She keeps using the phrase ""right now"".",0
4304,relationships,"Whenever I ask her about us she says ""right now, no, but in the future who knows?""",0
4305,relationships,I decided to put no contact measures into place as I could not give her what she wants while staying in contact with her.,0
4306,relationships,"When this happened she was bawling over the phone, but she never questioned it.",0
4307,relationships,"I've been with my girlfriend since I was I was 16, and there are no real problems.",0
4308,relationships,"For the past few months, I don't find myself enjoying being around her anymore, enjoy talking to her, or wanting to do anything ""special"" in general like I used to.",0
4309,relationships,I'm not interested in anybody else by any means.,0
4310,relationships,"She has helped me with a lot, would do anything or me, and has never done anything to hurt me or cheated.",0
4311,relationships,"She's the best partner you could ask for, but even still when she talks I don't want to listen.",0
4312,relationships,"But we didn't talk about it the morning after, and life went on.",0
4313,relationships,"Over the next year, we would continue to stay up late at house parties or whatever the occasion was (until 3, 4, 5 AM) about once a month, and just talk and talk and talk, until we inevitably hooked up.",0
4314,relationships,Keep in mind he was still dating someone else.,0
4315,relationships,"Eventually during one of these moments, I worked up the courage to indirectly get a pulse on his feelings.",0
4316,relationships,"More or less, he said he thinks about me multiple times a day, which was different from anyone else he ""dated"" prior.",0
4317,relationships,"She never disclosed any of this to me, and probably never would have if the embassy hadn't discovered it first.",0
4318,relationships,"In her words, she was afraid I would lose all interest in her if I found out she was married before.",0
4319,relationships,"Truth be told, I likely would have, as I was still young when we first met.",0
4320,relationships,She claims she left that husband because of the abuse she received from him and his relatives ((still lived with his parents)).,0
4321,relationships,"I was crushed at that time, as we had only been married for about a month.",0
4322,relationships,Whats the chances of his employer asking for his certificate randomly?,0
4323,relationships,I feel like he cant apply to other jobs at more prestigious companies.,0
4324,relationships,"As someone who who tried very hard to get her degree and succeeded, his lack of care and access to these jobs undermines my work.",0
4325,relationships,"My mom [54F] has catered to his every need since marriage, and although she complains about it constantly, she still goes along with it.",0
4326,relationships,"There are some events concerning him that have occurred throughout my life that have caused me to come to resent him (and my mom too sort of): From as far back as I can remember, to this day (although it's much less now), my parents have had screaming matches.",0
4327,relationships,"My dad's face turning red and spit flying, as he yells and often curses at the top of his lungs to my mom, and her crying and screaming back.",0
4328,relationships,But I did give her the benefit of the doubt because that could have just been her character.,0
4329,relationships,However the things she were saying were very icky for my liking and I was uncomfortable about 10 minutes in.,0
4330,relationships,It’s very vague in my mind as it was a while ago but what I remember was that She said “ I hope you dont mind Harry cuddling me when I’m poorly and when we Netflix and chill” and “what are WE doing Friday?” (Me and Harry arranged a date night as we were both off work and college on this day. ),0
4331,relationships,I remember looking at harry and kind of giving him a confused WTF look.,0
4332,relationships,I started noticing her internet behavior more over the past few months and it's been kind of bothering me.,0
4333,relationships,"My girlfriend is a very intelligent and mature person, but when she gets online it's like she acts totally different.",0
4334,relationships,"For one, she sends me screencaps of her ""trolling"" people.",0
4335,relationships,"I mean, trolling?",0
4336,relationships,She's almost 30.,0
4337,relationships,The first is my girlfriend of around 9 months.,0
4338,relationships,She doesn't really like her current living situation and suggested we look together.,0
4339,relationships,"The positives here are that we get along pretty well as far as my relationships have gone, and it would save me money, probably around $5-600 a month.",0
4340,relationships,That's not insignificant.,0
4341,relationships,"The thing is I probably *could* be ready for that step if I had to, I'm just not really for or against it.",0
4342,relationships,"Alright, I'll try to keep this as short as possible.",0
4343,relationships,**Some Background:** I have a co-worker we'll call Pamela.,0
4344,relationships,"Pamela is disabled from complications and defects from when she was born; she has a brain shunt, and some cognitive issues.",0
4345,relationships,"However, it's not enough to impair her too greatly obviously because she has worked in the call center I work at for about 12 years or so, and in other call centers before this.",0
4346,relationships,"She receives accommodations for a disability at work though, such as having to meet less strict stats (like time per phone call, or time spent working offline) and being allowed to take a ""rest"" break if her disability causes her issues.",0
4347,relationships,"This has caused quite a few disagreements, as we often compromise for a ""quickie"" at some later time.",0
4348,relationships,"I love her dearly, and want to make this work, but I'm also worried that I shouldn't have gone this far into a relationship without a frame of reference for what I would want in one.",0
4349,relationships,"She is my first girlfriend, but I'm afraid to throw away a relationship that's caused me to love someone so dearly.",0
4350,relationships,"I've been cautious up to this point, but it does appear as though we have begun to get financially ""entangled"".",0
4351,relationships,"And it may be a bit out of context, but I do have to thank my 4 best men for being here with me all the way, I couldn’t do this without them.",0
4352,relationships,"Finally, we are here at the present day.",0
4353,relationships,It’s been 2 years since we broke up.,0
4354,relationships,"My ex still hates me with a burning passion, but I have learned to ignore it and have mostly moved on from the experience.",0
4355,relationships,"I don’t hold any sort of animosity towards her, but I have had the tendency to start to drift off and start pitying myself and reflecting out loud a bit too much when in conversation with my dear friend.",0
4356,relationships,Hi everyone.,0
4357,relationships,I met a great guy - let's call him Dave - about a year ago.,0
4358,relationships,We started off as friends but started dating around November.,0
4359,relationships,Let me preface this by saying that Dave is probably the best boyfriend I've ever had.,0
4360,relationships,"He'll drive an hour just to see me, always pays when we go out for food or drinks and is reluctant even when I insist to pay.",0
4361,relationships,"I do not originate from that country, but my family lives only a 3 hour ride away.",0
4362,relationships,After Christmas (which we did not spend together) I came to visit her and her family and eventually spend New Years Eve with them.,0
4363,relationships,"It was all fine apart from some little ""fights"" between my gf and me.",0
4364,relationships,There were always some small things that led to discussions.,0
4365,relationships,"For example: We went out with the dog and when we got back, my shoes were pretty dirty.",0
4366,relationships,"She didn’t have room for it where she was currently living, it had been so long since she was able to create.",0
4367,relationships,"We moved things out of storage, into the studio.",0
4368,relationships,I was so excited to not only be providing this place for her but to be the one she trusted with some of the most precious things to her.,0
4369,relationships,"I bought her a clay wheel and accessories, she wanted to work in the medium again.",0
4370,relationships,"I’ll never forget the first evening we threw clay together, it was very meaningful and romantic.",0
4371,relationships,"When we got to Food Lion, she got out of the car and said, “Your daddy bought you this car.” And slammed the car door and left.",0
4372,relationships,She apologized later.,0
4373,relationships,"New Years eve, my mom (65) gets a call from my cousin (50-60 don’t know her age), the primary caregiver for my grandma, that my uncle (same uncle from earlier) was admitted to the hospital the day before and was ready to be released.",0
4374,relationships,She couldn’t pick him up because she lives an hour away.,0
4375,relationships,My mom and I picked him up and took him home.,0
4376,relationships,I dated my ex-girlfriend for 6 years.,0
4377,relationships,She was madly in love with me for most of the relationship then had a falling out in the last year of the relationship where things turned ugly.,0
4378,relationships,I went through depression and hit a rough patch which also made me insecure which gave her the power in the relationship.,0
4379,relationships,"I also put us both through some unnecessary times and abused the love and time she gave me, she tried really hard, I was too stubborn.",0
4380,relationships,Eventually near the end I was a bit vulnerable and she left.,0
4381,relationships,"Sally is around the same age, 25 I assume, (can’t confirm numbers, sorry about that) and she quickly became a red flag for me.",0
4382,relationships,He would mention her name occasionally and how our love for the same type of shows was shared with Sally.,0
4383,relationships,Sally and I met a few times.,0
4384,relationships,The first time was when we planned a day out shopping with a mutual friend who was single at the time and my bf decided to invite Sally.,0
4385,relationships,"I thought that was a little weird, but justified it because 1) I had never met her and thought that would be a great opportunity to and 2) He said maybe the two of them would hit it off.",0
4386,relationships,--- TL;DR; Ghosted after over a month of talking to a guy.,0
4387,relationships,Met in hotel room.,0
4388,relationships,Made out but didn't have sex.,0
4389,relationships,If he didn't want to cheat or chickened out at the last minute why would he carry on so long with me?,0
4390,relationships,She would be coming to the states for the first time in over 10 years on Dec. 30.,0
4391,relationships,I was ecstatic to finally meet my MIL.,0
4392,relationships,We've chatted on several occasions and she is truly a great person.,0
4393,relationships,Rob was excited too so he wanted to make her trip memorable.,0
4394,relationships,He decided he wanted to get a family portrait painted for her as a late Christmas gift.,0
4395,relationships,Anna claimed he was a distant friend and had been kicked out of his house in the frigid weather.,0

4407,relationships,I didn't aid in the application process at all.,0
4408,relationships,He did everything.,0
4409,relationships,"He wanted me to go there because it was cheap, and he assumed that if it were otherwise either i would just do nothing or spend a lot more money on school than he'd like.",0

4429,relationships,Maybe 2-3 crazy fights but nothing major.,0
4430,relationships,"Joe came back, frankly Joe spent ~ a year asking me to go out with him and my gut did not agree, it just felt off, now don’t get me wrong I have loved Joe since I was 17 but I just felt like this wouldn’t be right.",0
4431,relationships,"I asked Joe for a year, I studied far away, and it was my last year at uni, I asked Joe to give me that year.",0
4432,relationships,But Joe said Nah.,0
4433,relationships,"Joe gave the whole I have changed speech which every girl has probably heard a gazillion times in her life, but still thinks its novel.",0
4434,relationships,"He is (objectively) pretty unlikable- only talks about himself when speaking to you- but you know, I try to see the best in people and ignored it when I talk to him.",0
4435,relationships,He claims he is bisexual.,0
4436,relationships,"He introduced me to his lab partner, my current girlfriend, and I asked him if he was interested before pursuing her.",0
4437,relationships,He stated clearly no.,0

4454,relationships,I saved myself the embarrassment and just didnt go out that night.,0
4455,relationships,I texted him the next day to ask what happened.,0
4456,relationships,Its been a week already since this happened and be hasn't once texted me.,0
4457,relationships,And after every episode with them he treats me like shit for a couple hours at work I assume wondering if I know about his behaviour and if I’ll say anything.,0
4458,relationships,"It’s my world, and my people, and I’m his superior.",0
4459,relationships,"He’s not going to win a power struggle, so I don’t even have to worry about it.",0
4460,relationships,Other days we get along fine from 9-5.,0
4461,relationships,"I am moving in with my BF and am fine with doing it 'early' because I love him and want to spend more time with him, I am moving back to my hometown where I have a large safety net, and we are choosing an apartment that he can afford on his own if he needs to.",0
4462,relationships,"I know having a back up plan doesn't sound romantic, but both he and I have discussed all of the above, and both of us are long term planners who place 'back-up' plans in place in case anything goes awry.",0
4463,relationships,I have always been in relationships where I was still able to be an independent unit and avoid too much commitment because I was always scared to lose my independence.,0
4464,relationships,"But this is the first relationship where I feel like we're a really good fit, and it doesn't feel like a sacrifice I don't want to make.",0
4465,relationships,"I will still be doing a lot of things on my own, he is also an independent person, and both of us have lived on our own for years and know we can take care of ourselves.",0
4466,relationships,I apologised and thought that was the end of it.,0
4467,relationships,"It’s gotten to the point that if I walk into a room, she’ll leave straight away, and if she doesn’t leave, or if I start talking to her or someone else, she sighs a lot so I know my presence is not wanted.",0
4468,relationships,"If I’m in her general direction of travel, she’ll be sure to make a wide berth around me, and the only time she’s spoken a full sentence to me was to say “thanks for my present” that I got her for Christmas.",0
4469,relationships,Then we get to tonight.,0
4470,relationships,Eva and one of my brothers are staying over at our cousins house.,0
4471,relationships,I'll have written a letter to give to her.,0
4472,relationships,The letter is to repeat what I wanted to say for later so that she can read in case she has any misunderstandings or if I don't communicate it well.,0
4473,relationships,Obviously I don't want to say the reason is because of her physical appearance.,0
4474,relationships,Should I say I only see her as a friend but nothing greater than that?,0
4475,relationships,I've been dating a single mom with two kids from two different guys who help out.,0

4484,relationships,Normal start of our day.,0
4485,relationships,"He asked ""was the card worth the wait?""",0
4486,relationships,"I answered ""Yes, I cried, at the park"" he jokingly said ""of course you did, tiny tears x"" and then he asked ""did you take photos of the chocolates?""",0
4487,relationships,"I said ""yes babe"" and sent him the photo - he was still online but the last 2 messages wasnt read.",0
4488,relationships,"The next message i sent was all about my day - that wasnt sent anymore, he was offline... i thought he was getting ready for his work and his phone died or his network... after an hour, I got worried, so I sent messages on all social media that he has, which I know.",0
4489,relationships,"I had no problem with that, but was kind of surprised that this was the first time I was hearing his cousin's name that he missed so dearly he spent 600 dollars on a plane ticket to go visit.",0
4490,relationships,"I did not think much of it, but noticed that over the course of a couple weeks, he was constantly getting snapchats from Jessica, but was reluctant to open them in front of me.",0
4491,relationships,"That was another thing that surprised me because he always would open things in front of me, and never had a problem with me on his phone.",0
4492,relationships,"If he did open a snapchat from Jessica, he kind of pulled his phone closer to him so I couldn't see his screen.",0
4493,relationships,"I noticed his phone background one day, and saw that it was a happy birthday card with a picture drawn on it, signed from Jessica.",0
4494,relationships,When we had our first fight I did EVERYTHING I could to gain her back in my life.,0
4495,relationships,"I quit smoking cigarettes because she went on a ""I hate all drugs and anything smokable"" rant.",0
4496,relationships,I tried to be more mindful and kind because she said I was the opposite.,0

4498,relationships,4 months later she let me back in and I was so fucking happy.,0
4499,relationships,My girlfriend and I met through a messaging app.,0
4500,relationships,"We come from the same country and speak the same language, so there is a sense of familiarity and closeness right from the start.",0
4501,relationships,"However, as we grow closer, I'm starting to feel like she does not value our relationship as much as I do.",0
4502,relationships,I always put her above all else.,0
4503,relationships,I always try to find ways to accommodate her busy schedule.,0
4504,relationships,Some day it’s gonna piss them off and she’ll get killed.,0
4505,relationships,She lets people go ahead of her in line if she has more items than them.,0
4506,relationships,She lets people out of junctions even if she’s running late to places.,0

4508,relationships,Gave up her seat on a bus once when she knows I have a bad back and like to sit down.,0
4509,relationships,"I've never been on this side of the road, being the one to let someone know I'm not interested.",0
4510,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Person wants to hook me up with his adoptive sister, we have nothing in common, how do I tell her that I'm not interested?",0
4511,relationships,I want that.,0
4512,relationships,I want him as well as a SO but maybe I need more time.,0
4513,relationships,Maybe I'm more invested than even he is.,0
4514,relationships,"At some point in the past year, we discussed living together.",0
4515,relationships,She seemed to be okay with it and never had any objections.,0
4516,relationships,"Since both our rental agreements will soon expire (hers in May and mine in July), I started looking for a new place online.",0
4517,relationships,"However, I noticed that she never really responded enthusiastically about anything I showed her or just plain ignored it.",0
4518,relationships,"Last weekend, I confronted her and she admitted that she no longer wants to move in together, saying it is too soon for her and that she had been thinking about it for a long time.",0
4519,relationships,My girlfriend and I have been dating now for 3 months.,0
4520,relationships,We have a very happy relationship most of the time.,0
4521,relationships,I love her and she loves me and we spend almost all our time together.,0
4522,relationships,She can be insecure at times and has a couple mood swings where she can be very happy to very upset.,0
4523,relationships,I do my best to bring her out of those slumps and usually I do.,0
4524,relationships,Email her?,0
4525,relationships,"She lives in his hometown, so an in-person meeting is not possible, nor do I think it would be wise.",0
4526,relationships,Should I do it anonymously?,0
4527,relationships,"Should I provide screen shots of our conversations right off the bat, or wait and see if she requests it?",0
4528,relationships,I could write a long book about it.,0
4529,relationships,The issue: My current issue is a strange one and I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts about it.,0
4530,relationships,"Whenever my inlaws visit and stay the night, they bring 1 set of clean clothes and wash the ones they are wearing EVERY NIGHT.",0

4542,relationships,"He says she is a great girl, caring for him and he thinks she loves him.",0
4543,relationships,"He, however, felt mostly intense passion and says he misses the spiritual connection.",0
4544,relationships,"I think its still too soon for him to know after a few days, as the group of friends returned home and he is some more time on the road.",0
4545,relationships,"He said even if he does not know what will happen, he must explore the passion with the new girl and he is happy that it happened.",0
4546,relationships,He said he feels a bit guilty cause its mostly passion he feels and the girl seems to be really into him.,0
4547,relationships,"The problem is that before I even ask for him to do this like a grown up, I have gone fully Zuko fire bender mode and decided to unleash my wrath on Joe for not doing this.",0
4548,relationships,Other stupid occasions I have done this?,0
4549,relationships,"Well, did it cause when we were long distance he wouldn’t initiate calling (I know Joe too well to know this is just unnatural for him), holding my hand more than he does, coming home and giving me a kiss, honestly he has a faster pace and I even equated him sometimes not walking at my pace as him not caring.",0
4550,relationships,"He puts up with my rage and abuse, he helps with my mother (who is nuts herself, so I guess I take after her), he has offered financial help if I need it (doing MSc).",0

4568,relationships,"He has absolutely no ice fishing gear, but knows Tyler does and, again, uses Tyler under the guise of “friendship” so he can go.",0
4569,relationships,"AKA, I don’t get to go anymore.",0
4570,relationships,He agreed.,0
4571,relationships,"I told him a million times, when we were together and after we broke up, that loyalty is my #1 in relationship, period.",0

4574,relationships,"Despite that, all the following is true: * We have both called each other BF/GF and referred to there being a relationship * We have had (oral, but not PIV yet) sex a few times, slept together naked, and have had many intimate conversations, including the last time we saw each other * We both mentioned early on that we aren't currently dating anyone else * We have both talked about going to specific events and doing things together in the future",0
4575,relationships,We were long-distance for a few months although we visited each other almost every weekend.,0
4576,relationships,In that time she was very jealous and controlled my movements because she thought I was doing something with very girl who looked at me.,0

4578,relationships,"Nothing sexual, just selfies on a night out or whatever.",0
4579,relationships,"Back in November of 2015, my Junior year of college, I was a hermit socially but had many great and supportive friends (funnily enough were 90% women).",0
4580,relationships,"However, I was lonely as hell, had never dated, and it was driving me mad and depressing me.",0
4581,relationships,"I didn't let it show though, except to one or two friends who knew me very well.",0

4597,relationships,"When I made up the excuse that I had to be up for something early in the morning, he demanded to know what was wrong with our relationship.",0
4598,relationships,"I kept calmly assuring him that we were fine, and that I just needed rest that night.",0
4599,relationships,To make up for it I made a cute little note and I made him a batch of his favorite cookies.,0
4600,relationships,"I was honestly so damn proud of the gift when I finished putting it together, it looked awesome!",0
4601,relationships,"To add some context, I have attended a few games with him (and the rest of the family) and absolutely loved them.",0
4602,relationships,"I didn’t care about the actual games themselves, but I loved being there with my family and the cool atmosphere and stuff.",0
4603,relationships,"Well, apparently my dad didn’t think it was so awesome.",0
4604,relationships,"She then decided to go to a party without me and said ""I would cancel my plans to see you, but you won't do the same for me.",0
4605,relationships,even though she was the one who left.,0
4606,relationships,I told her I didn't want to see her tonight after she tried to bait me into going over to her house.,0

4613,relationships,I was upset and it took a couple of years of us discussing this before I started to feel more comfortable with things.,0
4614,relationships,"We eventually started swinging (only about once every couple of months and always same room) as it seemed like a way for us to explore this part of her together, and it ended up being a lot of fun and something I really enjoyed that brought us closer together.",0
4615,relationships,"Well, it’s been a couple of years and I’ve felt happy and comfortable with where we are at but  I decided to ask my wife the other day and she said she was happy but she also had a desire to date people separately, and would be willing to try it if I was.",0
4616,relationships,"This isn't the first time this has happened, even with my ex I used to put effort into creating funny and deep conversations and she'd make quite surface level replies, but I thought it was because she was severely depressed so I didn't mind making an effort with her.",0
4617,relationships,She doesn't have many hobbies and works in a pub so I can't talk about her interests really as the only think she kinda likes is textiles and she doesn't do it anymore as she's so focused on her job.,0
4618,relationships,"I should probably mention she's really really shy, which she has admitted to me.",0
4619,relationships,"For example, when we meet in person, she's so nervous that she's physically shaking for about 15 minutes until she relaxes.",0

4623,relationships,"He doesn't go out with ""real life"" friends, except if I invite him out with my friends.",0
4624,relationships,"Numerically - yes, we spend time together, but about 12 of those hours are spent sleeping.",0

4636,relationships,"I have enough money to buy a house, my girlfriend has only just started working.",0

4638,relationships,"However, when I spoke to her.",0
4639,relationships,"That being said, I love her when she is good, otherwise we wouldn’t be together.",0
4640,relationships,She tells she didn’t want to tell all those mean things.,0
4641,relationships,But then she does it again.,0
4642,relationships,"I’m thinking what I can do, and I’ve come up with the following idea: She is straight-A university student, so I’ve devised a rating system for handling aggression.",0
4643,relationships,This is where she met her current best friend.,0
4644,relationships,Let's call him Rob.,0
4645,relationships,"Now, she met this guy while she was still dating her ex.",0
4646,relationships,"They had issues after a couple of years (more than 2), apparently that was the time she and her best friend started to get really close.",0
4647,relationships,"In her own words, they started texting a lot, going out with their colleagues a lot, etc.",0
4648,relationships,She'd deleted evidence years ago.,0
4649,relationships,"Yet she sat me down, told me she'd been  groomed and it was my fault for not telling her.",0
4650,relationships,It was my fault she'd be single forever.,0
4651,relationships,We're talking incidents happening from when I was 6 through to 16.,0
4652,relationships,"He put a hand on my shoulder and smiled and said, ""You sure are.""",0
4653,relationships,It goes in a circle.,0
4654,relationships,He made me feel better there by affirming that he thinks I'm worthwhile.,0
4655,relationships,"Great, that'll probably get on his nerves.",0
4656,relationships,I’m not living a lavish lifestyle or rolling around in money.,0
4657,relationships,I explained to her that if we divided rent based on income percentage she would actually be paying more per month.,0
4658,relationships,All this on top of the fact that she turned down a free car.,0
4659,relationships,It feels really unfair because I think she blames me for moving us to a “more expensive” location for my new job.,0
4660,relationships,So in her mind she shouldn’t have to pay anything more than the dirt-cheap rent I was charging her to live with me at my house.,0
4661,relationships,feel free to delete or disregard if this isn't in the right sub.,0
4662,relationships,I saw a guy for months having sex a couple times a week.,0
4663,relationships,"But not just that, hanging out and being friends too.",0
4664,relationships,In December he asked me what we were.,0
4665,relationships,I knew that this was something we should talk about and so we sat down and talked it out.,0
4666,relationships,I’m a Canadian traveling in India and staying for a few days at a homestay (paid accommodation).,0
4667,relationships,At home I have a beloved rescue dog.,0
4668,relationships,Three adult dogs live here at the homestay: one male and two nursing females.,0
4669,relationships,The dogs’ body language towards the people who live and work here is positive.,0
4670,relationships,"The dogs wag, follow people, accept physical affection.",0
4671,relationships,"i have asked for her patient while he gets trained, but i understand her not wanting to potentially move into an  environment that disturbers her normal way of life, but thats 6 months from now.",0
4672,relationships,I am confident that training would fix 70% of the issues that she has with my dog.,0
4673,relationships,"To me a loving and healthy relationship is one that can come to compromises and that are no winners or losers, but agreements in place to help solve issues TOGETHER .",0
4674,relationships,"If she has trouble with compromising on a proper solution now, what will happen when it comes to or much larger life decisions like buying a house or moving to a new city.",0
4675,relationships,"I was about to explain to her that we would be back later that night and if she was good, we'd bring her a treat.",0
4676,relationships,But Mom just scooped her up and coddled her like you would a 9 month old who was crying because they were a bit cranky.,0
4677,relationships,I [26F] have been with my boyfriend [30M] for almost 5 years now.,0
4678,relationships,We live together and talk about spending the rest of our lives together.,0
4679,relationships,"While being home for the holidays, I was re-aquatinted with a friend who helped me through a tough time in high school.",0
4680,relationships,"In a completely platonic way, he supported me after I was left heartbroken by my first love.",0
4681,relationships,"He has always been compassionate, understanding, and non-judgmental and has given advice that I still live by today.",0
4682,relationships,She taught me a bunch at first.,0
4683,relationships,In the beginning of the week people asked what me and my Ex did.,0
4684,relationships,I informed them we broke up and it was due to infidelity on her part.,0
4685,relationships,"This was not a cool move, however, I knew her sister would try to paint me as the bad guy.",0
4686,relationships,I was spot on.,0
4687,relationships,"Since we are both the only child, we both feel an equal responsibility to carry on our family lines, regardless of our own gender.",0
4688,relationships,What do you guys think would be an equitable solution to this problem?,0
4689,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Girlfriend wants future children to have her last name, but I am not comfortable with that due to social conditioning and/or the backlash I would face from my own parents.",0
4690,relationships,"The new man almost immediately moved to the flat previously shared with her ex, which I found strange, but I know she cannot be alone, perhaps because of her troubled childhood/daddy issues.",0
4691,relationships,"She later confessed she was completely out of her mind in this period, and she would not do it if having a clear head.",0
4692,relationships,"They never really ended contact, despite all the hurt.",0
4693,relationships,"She even met with her ex after 3 months apart, confessing she misses him and cried.",0
4694,relationships,Since then things between them got complicated.,0
4695,relationships,- Constantly forgets where she put her cell phone (even though she keeps it in the same designated spot) - She was the money-person in my family.,0
4696,relationships,"Knew everyone's bank account numbers, credit card due dates, utility bills, etc.",0
4697,relationships,Recently handed the task of money management to my dad because she was forgetting to pay bills.,0
4698,relationships,"- On her way to the grocery store, forgot where she was driving to; ended up at my dad's work instead",0
4699,relationships,Then about 25 minutes later I got a message from her saying that she was downstairs with Annie and her friends pre-drinking so I came down.,0
4700,relationships,I asked her how long she was down for and she said the whole time as Annie was already downstairs.,0
4701,relationships,"I asked her why she didn't let me know everyone was downstairs already, instead of just leaving me in my room by myself to which she replied ""don't worry about it, it's no big deal.""",0
4702,relationships,"I said it seemed weird she just din't think to tell me for nearly half an hour to which she rolled her eyes and said ""oh don't you start.""",0
4703,relationships,I decided it wasn't worth getting annoyed about it and didn't bring it up again.,0
4704,relationships,"Any problem he had, he would blame on me.",0
4705,relationships,"I eventually got out of the relationship, and when I ended it, he began obsessively texting me up to 30 times a day, talking to my family and lying to them about what was happening, etc.",0
4706,relationships,He finally stopped when I threatened a restraining order.,0
4707,relationships,The last time we talked was in May 2017.,0
4708,relationships,I started my seizure while on the stairs and as a result was pretty badly injured.,0
4709,relationships,I broke my ankle and injured my knee.,0
4710,relationships,I also required stitches in my face.,0
4711,relationships,Let me make this very clear- I recognize that this experience must have been **terrifying** for Tom.,0
4712,relationships,"Also, stemming from the same background, I am still a virgin (he obviously is not) and I’m not quire sure how I feel about engaging in sexual intercourse with him.",0
4713,relationships,"Whenever we “talk” about sex, I feel like I’m lying about how I feel.",0
4714,relationships,It’s more of an interest in learning the different aspects of sex than actual sexual arousal (I’ve been questioning the possibility of asexuality).,0
4715,relationships,"If anything, I feel kind of giddy that someone thinks of me in that way but not in the “I want to have sex with you” way.",0
4716,relationships,"I’m trying to engage him with pictures/videos/etc., but it feels all fake to me.",0
4717,relationships,The problem is one of these guy friends.,0
4718,relationships,I'm typically pretty shy in new social settings and don't really like to make be at the focus of anyone's attention unless I'm comfortable with them.,0
4719,relationships,"When I first met these guys, it was like 2 polar opposites met.",0
4720,relationships,"I'm fairly quiet, reserved, respectful and I like to think I'm a smart person.",0
4721,relationships,"These friends, this one friend in particular, are loud, boorish and really rude.",0
4722,relationships,I can hardly step into his room because that is where it is most concentrated.,0
4723,relationships,I love keeping a clean and nice smelling apartment.,0
4724,relationships,I don't mind doing extra cleaning and buying extra air fresheners to keep it that way.,0
4725,relationships,"However, Matt's BO literally follows him around and lingers where ever he goes.",0
4726,relationships,"Anyway, couple months down the line, I met her family, loved them, they loved me (they're first impression of me was, get this, me clogging they're toileting and it overflowing with me yelling SOS through the bathroom door.. it was awesome lol).",0
4727,relationships,L and I continued to grow even closer as my now senior year progressed (her junior).,0
4728,relationships,Then March happened.,0
4729,relationships,L started to act wierd.,0
4730,relationships,"She talked sarcastically about how my life is ""obviously so horrible"" and I'd say ""yeah, mom, it is.""",0
4731,relationships,"She denied yelling at us all the time, and said that if I can say she yells all the time then she can say I yell all the time too (at my little siblings), which is just not true.",0
4732,relationships,"I am nice to my siblings, excluding today where I was angry at everything.",0
4733,relationships,"She said that for months I've been terrorizing her about this ""yelling thing"" and how I think that one small mistake automatically means someone is a bad person.",0
4734,relationships,Sorry if this is kinda long... We met in highschool and became best friends.,0
4735,relationships,"Even after we still talked everyday, hang out almost every weekend and I felt everything was okay.",0
4736,relationships,She then started getting kinda distant e cold toward me and I had no idea why.,0
4737,relationships,I talked to friend in commom and she said my this friend(I'll call her P.) felt that I was too negative and was always complaining.,0
4738,relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Met this guy a few months ago, we've only hung out a few times.",0
4739,relationships,"I'm a little wary of the age gap and don't have much experience with accurately ""reading signals"".",0
4740,relationships,"He is mildly physically affectionate (leans towards me, hits my arm playfully, pulls things from my hair) and gives compliments that seem genuine and sincere, but aren't quite non platonic.",0
4741,relationships,What do you think/what should I look for?,0
4742,relationships,"Hello all, I'm a new submitter to this channel.",0
4743,relationships,I went here a few nights ago and honestly it's been helping me cope with my current situation by reading what others are going through.,0
4744,relationships,"One of the things I noticed is that a lot of responses are brutally honest -- and I am here for just that while still accepting that I'm a hopeless romantic who sees the value in ""If you really want it don't give up"".",0
4745,relationships,Let's get started -,0
4746,relationships,My online friend  -- let's call him Jim  -- is a Jehovah's Witness.,0
4747,relationships,I've known him on and off for about a decade.,0
4748,relationships,"Nowadays, we only email each other about thrice a year, but I still consider him one of my favorite online friends because of how deep and insightful our conversations are.",0
4749,relationships,We've rubbed each other the wrong way in the past because we have different ideas of God.,0
4750,relationships,I was raised as a Born Again Christian and am now looking into becoming a Unitarian Universalist.,0
4751,relationships,"I’ve been reading through the raised by narcissists subreddit that some of you linked to, and a lot of it matches with my experience growing up.",0
4752,relationships,The situation may be more severe then I had originally thought.,0
4753,relationships,"I am seeing a therapist for my anxiety, and the next time I have a session I’m going to bring get up everything I talked about here and maybe get some help in dealing with it.",0
4754,relationships,"Again, thanks to everyone who took time out of their day to give me advice when I was struggling, I really appreciate it.",0
4755,relationships,Sister kicked off because she wanted to come to.,0
4756,relationships,"It was a couple type thing and all of us were bringing a SO or a friend (if one of us didn’t have a partner) even if it wasn’t, I would have just wanted it to be Harry.",0
4757,relationships,As I don’t want his sister clinging on to us every single time.,0
4758,relationships,Harry asked me if she could come too because “it so unfair that you are isolating her like this.” I stood my ground and said that please can he just come.,0
4759,relationships,He said no.,0
4760,relationships,"come up and live with us and she'd leave me alone with him, wasted out of his mind, while she would be with her boyfriend (who shes now married to).",0
4761,relationships,Eventually I moved back with my dad and everything was fine.,0
4762,relationships,I'd call and talk to her and she sounded like she had her life together.,0
4763,relationships,"Well then they broke up for a short period of time, and she moved to live with her half siblings.",0
4764,relationships,"She would drink excessively, and call me and cry about her life.",0
4765,relationships,"I started talking to a girl, 'J', on Tinder about a month ago.",0
4766,relationships,"She's funny, attractive and quick-witted, however she was apprehensive to meet up for a drink to get to know each other in person straight away.",0
4767,relationships,We are both from the same town (we matched over Christmas) however she lives an hour and a half away in a much larger city.,0
4768,relationships,"She first claimed that she could not afford to travel to see me even when she was back in my town (she also refused to let me pay for anything involving her, including travel to her city to meet her), however said last week that she did not want to meet me until she knew that I was genuine about her, and wanted to talk on the phone every evening for a week.",0
4769,relationships,"If I did this, then she would meet me on the day afterwards.",0
4770,relationships,"His mother would say, ""Who would love you if you look like that?""",0
4771,relationships,"or ""Why couldn't I have a fit and handsome son.""",0
4772,relationships,So he has his own issues with his body image and weight.,0
4773,relationships,He also went a few years without being physical with anyone because he never thought that anyone would be interested or love him because of his appearance.,0
4774,relationships,He had a few years where he got very fit and had six pack but eventually lost it as he got older.,0
4775,relationships,"She never messaged him back, but I asked her why she still had him on Snapchat.",0
4776,relationships,I only asked it because she had claimed to have deleted her ex's on social media.,0
4777,relationships,"Whatever, that's a nice feeling and I'm glad, but at the same time it wouldn't really be an issue for me if she did still have them.",0
4778,relationships,Fast forward to last night... My fiance was acting all weird and put out so I tried figure out what was going on and what she was upset about.,0
4779,relationships,I have been trying to make plans recently and she keeps having things come up but i understand because i am doing it on kind of short notice.,0
4780,relationships,This last little bit after the break happened in about a 8 day span.,0
4781,relationships,TLDR: I am awkward and need some help with relationships.,0
4782,relationships,BACKGROUND: paul and i met 1.5 years ago on okcupid and hit it off right away.,0
4783,relationships,"at the time, we were both in long-term open relationships with other people, so we fell into a pretty quick routine that involved seeing each other once a week for a meal or drinks and sex [the best of his life, allegedly].",0
4784,relationships,"About 6 months into it/the December before last, he and his partner of 8 years broke up, which sent him into a bit of a depression/naturally intense period of introspection.",0
4785,relationships,"Independently/for unrelated reasons, my own longterm relationship also came to an end.",0
4786,relationships,Paul and I saw each other less but kept in touch.,0
4787,relationships,to me I feel like that is someone older than my current age dating an age that seems like a child to me....,0
4788,relationships,"I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a "" normal"" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any "" life skills"" and his answer was ""  not really"".",0
4789,relationships,What are people's thoughts on this?,0
4790,relationships,--- tl/dr...i'm creeped out by a man dating a woman 20 years younger even my last relationship was with a man 22 years older.,0
4791,relationships,"* Her, a week ago: Precious, how are you?",0
4792,relationships,(I ignored her.),0
4793,relationships,"* Her, Jan 1: Happy year precious, happy year love for more years at your side we haven't lived much together but we will stay all our lives to live and it that stays to live.",0
4794,relationships,**You are one of the best people I have met in my life.,0
4795,relationships,** You are one of the best people I have met in my life (she says this twice) that you have always been here for everything and you always will be.,0
