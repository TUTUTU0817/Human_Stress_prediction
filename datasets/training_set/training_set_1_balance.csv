anxiety,"I have tried many self massages, creams, baths, pads, you name it.",0
ptsd,"So I've basically got a plan: hoard all my drugs until Tuesday, OD that night with a combo of slit wrists and maybe even hanging.",0
survivorsofabuse,"This is why I was hoping that, if you are interested, you could send me stories of your experiences in an abusive relationship - whatever detail you choose to send, it doesn't have to be anything ""epic"" and ""grand,"" it could be the smallest segment that you hold significance to.",0
relationships,Made out but didn't have sex.,0
domesticviolence,He takes me and my sister there and tells her to pick out a desk.,0
relationships,"So yes, after these few ""errors"", I started to have trust issues.",0
relationships,"If we hadn't been together for so long, I would probably have blocked him and chased him, but I don't want that.",0
survivorsofabuse,They are often structurally linked.,0
relationships,Obviously I don't want to say the reason is because of her physical appearance.,0
ptsd,"With a switch blade and open arms In a sweater vest that covers a ragged undershirt stained with my innocence Through faces that are never the same as the ones I dread finding in the crowd In the night, I rediscover my love of mares and how hoarse I can be in the morning It's the taste of blood but I am not bleeding",1
ptsd,"The symptoms from this have been getting worse since then, and a good chunk of time from 2015 until now has been discovering what’s going on, coming to grips with a new reality, and managing those symptoms.",1
ptsd,i remember her getting drunk and and ranting about a fuck buddy she was angry at.,1
ptsd,i haven't seen her in 6 and a half years.,1
ptsd,"Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved.",1
ptsd,I do not blame her at all for this behaviour but I really need help understanding her before I get hurt worse than I already have.,1
ptsd,TL;DR I sometimes feel like I'm faking having PTSD despite never expecting I had it and then getting an official diagnosis from a doctor.,1
ptsd,I feel like I'm starting to get the control back over my life slowly.,1
ptsd,"I asked my doc to lower my Effexor because I feel like the the side-effects outweigh the good it does: It doesn't really help much for my anxiety, I feel depersonalization ever since I'm on medications and finally it gives me uncontrollable cravings.",1
ptsd,"All my issues with anger, alcohol abuse, frequent bouts of depression, difficulties focusing or concentrating at work, I attributed to my bipolar disorder, and that was all I worked on.",1
ptsd,"I didn't think that talking about anything would affect my bipolar disorder, and I **really** didn't want to talk about my trauma.",1
ptsd,I'm pretty broke and almost all of my money for now is going towards bills and food.,1
ptsd,"It is crazy how DEEP these emotional scars and wounds are, that I literally cried way harder in this session, than in even processing waking up in a hospital bald!",1
ptsd,"for ex, after it was over, i still had my tablet on for light and i was staring up at the ceiling when the ceiling and the wall behind me started to ripple weirdly, distorting, and then the tablet light went off abruptly and i startled and yelped and quickly turned it back on!",1
ptsd,i also felt someone sit on my bed next to me when i tried to leave the light off and sleep.,1
ptsd,"i didn't hear distant voices like the other time i was this 'hypervigilant,' but i heard some small noise rustle in the closet (just a house noise i assume) and it unnerved me.",1
ptsd,I'm overwhelmed looking at all the options on amazon.,1
ptsd,It's also not something I was ready to take on because...,1
ptsd,So many people have it worse than I do.,1
ptsd,Plus I know filing a claim at the VA is humiliating and I don’t want to go though what others I fear have.,1
ptsd,"I’m not bound to him anymore, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t panic at the end of each day in the split second that I think it’s going to happen again.",1
ptsd,I cut him out of my life.,1
ptsd,I've had a tough time finding another therapist.,1
ptsd,I went twice a week and it felt like my whole life revolved around trauma.,1
ptsd,So I'm feeling a bit lost with this.,1
ptsd,I've had asthma ever since I was a little kid and it has been flaring up really bad over the last few weeks...,1
ptsd,"The passive aggressive shit really got to me, and then I realized that I was being illegally paid.",1
ptsd,I describe it as feeling like I'm in a fight (physiologically) though I am sitting still or trying to sleep.,1
ptsd,"Loss of fine motor skills, hypervigilance, scanning all surroundings and people as if they are about to hit me and I have to hit back.",1
ptsd,"I could be stretching, but I feel like this ""fight"" response as opposed to my old ""flight"" or ""freeze"" response has effected even the emotional aspects of my attacks.",1
ptsd,I am just too numb and burned out.,1
ptsd,"I can't give them what they need, the regular sex or the emotional intimacy, and I just end up feeling guilty.",1
ptsd,"Recovery feels familiar, so it's less scary, but I'm also so much more tired of it all.",1
ptsd,I want to move on.,1
ptsd,My heart races and palpitates.,1
ptsd,"I've gone on autopilot, but I've never experienced anything like an out of body experience.",1
ptsd,"When this intense part fades I just get stuck in my head for the rest of the day, exhausted.",1
ptsd,How do you cope when ain't nobody got time for that?,1
ptsd,"My grandmother was a bitch to my mother, my mother was a bitch to me, I had to act out in a way or another.",1
ptsd,"I've been told I show symptoms of BPD, ADHD, but I haven't been diagnosed clinically.",1
ptsd,"“I’m writing this, because I am experiencing and attempting to avoid a full blown panic attack.",1
ptsd,My dream keeps playing in my head like a record and each time i get a glimpse of the record I avoid it.,1
ptsd,I was abusive and my mother was scared for her life.,1
ptsd,The first time I remember her telling everyone she was scared I would kill her I was about 7.,1
ptsd,Me and my sisters relationship has been strained most of my life but recently she had been opening up to me about the neglect and some fat shaming she experienced as a child.,1
ptsd,It's pretty embarrassing in social and professional settings to the point people think I'm faking but I really can't control my reaction.,1
ptsd,I was diagnosed Bipolar and BPD however this symptom in particular doesn't really match up with either of those.,1
ptsd,"As far as I know I'm not officially diagnosed PTSD, doctors I've seen have confirmed symptoms seeing as I had a very traumatic childhood.",1
ptsd,"If I ever run into them, I wish I could yell out,” rapist!",1
ptsd,"Gosh, I know.",1
ptsd,It's been about a year and a half since the event that set my mental health for a loop.,1
ptsd,"I never sought any help before, I had one bad experience with therapy a decade ago, and never went back, I didn't figure I was helpable.",1
ptsd,"Woke up 4 days later, intubated and paralyzed.",1
ptsd,"Didn't know if I was locked in, had suffered brain damage from lack of oxygen, I had no idea what was happening.",1
ptsd,"I quit Facebook, Twitter, and Instragram, essentially shutting myself off from the world.",1
ptsd,I feel good just feeling like nobody notices me.,1
ptsd,"Well, I had a bad binge eating episode and stopped, and my father proceeded to stop talking to me.",1
ptsd,"I’ve done a lot of reflecting on my childhood, trying to figure out if there were times he was like this that I had normalized, but with my therapist and my mother we have concluded that he never used to be like this.",1
ptsd,"I honestly dont think i can live long with this, but i do care about her and want to do something back for her.",1
ptsd,I was pretty much done with my live and lost all fate and interest in things.,1
ptsd,It all is just so tiresome you know?.,1
ptsd,"They always tend to worry, so this was something I knew they really couldn't do anything about so I didn't want them to worry for nothing.",1
ptsd,There's also just the mental health stigma and as a guy that makes it harder too.,1
ptsd,I also have a sister that I have never been very close to.,1
ptsd,"I first thought it‘s just something physical, the lack of iron in my blood or something.. never thought it would be something this deep.",1
ptsd,"I’m not sure if this makes a difference, but my mom also had it for a while when my dad died, so I’m not sure if that has any effect on me or not.",1
ptsd,"His mom came, he freaked out and got angry.",1
ptsd,He almost slammed the door on his mom's head/hand and I freaked out and pushed him away from the door.,1
ptsd,His mom freaked out over the condition he was in.,1
ptsd,"I never doubted reality before the abuse, and I have never done so outside of the abuse.",1
ptsd,"I know it's a young relationship, but it's hard adjusting to changes especially since i went from seeing him every day to not seeing him at all anymore.",1
ptsd,Friday i had a woodworking competition and everything went really good at first but then it just got worse and worse and my ptsd started to kick in.,1
ptsd,I felt really aggressive and angry and sad all at once.,1
ptsd,My friends saw that there was something going on and asked what was going on but at that moment everything that gets told is getting picked up as bad in my head so it only made me angry'r.,1
ptsd,"It was my dream to win this competition, i practiced so hard and then this happened and to make it worse i had a really bad dream the night before that everything was going bad etc and well the dream came true.",1
ptsd,"- mum was disabled in a wheelchair at times, in and out of hospital all the years I was growing up.",1
ptsd,I'm not upset with him for having a panic attack.,1
ptsd,On the way back up the stairs her knee started to hurt or she hit or whatever.,1
ptsd,"She was sitting on the stairs just sobbing away, doing her thing where she's cussing under her breathe.",1
ptsd,I've been sleeping on the couch since March.,1
ptsd,I had dreams of stuff he did to me in that bed.,1
ptsd,It didn't go away until the next day.,1
ptsd,Thanks.. **Edit 2** I forgot to say that my father is a completely different person now - but when I see him so much as take a sip of alcohol it all floods back to me and I get extremely terrified and nervous.,1
ptsd,I feel like I’m suffocating him.,1
ptsd,"This happened pretty often and I never really paid no mind to it, once again, I was a kid and didn't really think anything of it.",1
ptsd,I remember her taking me to my grandparents (her side) for the weekend quite a few times - and being horribly saddened by just being dumped off by her so she could go see different men.,1
ptsd,Once I was fifteen (february of '06) I got into an argument with my father and I wasn't taking his BS anymore.,1
ptsd,Sure maybe amother day will creep up and it'll feel like someone hit the reset button on your world again.,1
ptsd,"According to my mom, I didn't start talking until I started preschool at 4 years old, and still wouldn't talk at home... but teachers said that I wouldn't stop talking at school.",1
ptsd,"the reality is no matter how bad or how old he is, he is still her son and she cant shake off that biological attachment she has towards him and not worry about him.",1
ptsd,I was very severally bullied by the kids there.,1
ptsd,"When I do open up, all I can think is ""He's probably bored and wishing I'll stop talking.""",1
ptsd,He has voiced his frustration that he can't relate and that I struggle.,1
ptsd,It is so hard for me to think he knew any better.,1
ptsd,I find it frustrating though as i have just drove someone away who i really liked.,1
ptsd,He has ended up deleting and blocking me as he didnt at all help with reassurance which just made my mind go into overdrive creating scenarios that were probably non existent.,1
ptsd,This situation was over the top and heartbreaking that my parents would rather not work with a therapist (i've even suggest family therapy) and just decide to ban me from the house.,1
ptsd,I understand that isolating myself from them is the best option and I know it will be hard.,1
ptsd,I dont know what to make of him telling me I only care about being right.,1
ptsd,"But sometimes I feel bad that he has to see me freak out, or the flashbacks.",1
ptsd,When I black out.,1
ptsd,I feel bad.,1
ptsd,"She has trust issues after suffering abuse from her birth parents at a young age, and her situation is only complicated further with bipolar depression and fetal-alcohol syndrome.",1
ptsd,I know I sound like a total stalker but I was just really obsessed and I regret everything I did now that I'm older and wiser.,1
ptsd,"I don't savour these atrocities, but I feel like I must keep consuming them.",1
ptsd,I just don't know.,1
ptsd,I almost started crying but I didnt know why.,1
ptsd,It all gets mixed up in my head.,1
ptsd,"She pretty much ruined my life, and I experienced all kinds of abuse while I was with her (and even when we were apart), including emotional, mental and physical.",1
ptsd,People are abrasive and mean and stupid and they shit on each other all the time and are presumptive.,1
ptsd,Blame everything that we're not fucking perfect.,1
ptsd,I'm a bit jumpy as well as a bit of an animated person.,1
ptsd,He will become extremely anxious and at times very angry.,1
ptsd,"When I asked him how I could be better at helping him through it, he became even more upset stating that he always tells me what to do and I need to figure this out on my own.",1
ptsd,"There are many events thaat I have PTSD from, but somehow, even though it was one of the hardest things I have ever done.",1
ptsd,Made her feel shitty.,1
ptsd,I feel really guilty over it.,1
ptsd,"I know part of the problem may be how much I've repressed and can't feel, but...",1
ptsd,"I don't know, I feel I've exaggerated so much.",1
ptsd,"I haven't been having nightmares, and my ""flashbacks"" don't feel like flashbacks so much as ""regressive anxious states.""",1
ptsd,"I can think of the trauma I've been through and talk about it, but it doesn't feel like anything disturbing.",1
ptsd,"About 5 years ago I started feeling small signs of PTSD but just brushed it off like it wasn’t a real thing until it just kept getting worse and eating away at me, until I realized enough is enough.",1
ptsd,I thought maybe I have PTSD but then I would contradict myself and say that it’s not real and I don’t have it which would make me feel worse.,1
ptsd,"I have complex PTSD which I have only just been diagnosed with, prior to this they diagnosed me with borderline personality disorders and bipolar which are now not correct.",1
ptsd,"I came to realize later - and I denied it, basically just calling it a celebrity crush and nothing more - that I was in love with this musician.",1
ptsd,"I've mentioned very vaguely that I live with PTSD and ""blah blah childhood trauma, et cetera"".",1
ptsd,All of the other kids didn’t know whether to cry with him or look on in horror at the situation.,1
ptsd,I have a VA disability rating of 40% due to PTSD/Anxiety/depression and ringing in my ears from a tour in Afghanistan.,1
ptsd,just moved for a job in DC and my old unit is now too far to travel to.,1
ptsd,"For some background, I recognize that I tend to overreact to normal things, I have panic attacks when people innocently flirt with me for example, and I’ve flown off the handle when too many men have even just looked at me in too short of a space of time.",1
ptsd,She was really worried about being retraumatized by her birth.,1
ptsd,But he is phoning me today yelling and accusing me of paranoid stuff and hanging up.,1
ptsd,"I know I’m going to get kicked, I know I’m going to be in pain but I also see the beauty in between the clouds.",1
ptsd,My traumas now seem to have died down a bit and do not easily control my emotions and thinking.,1
ptsd,"Sometimes I wake up at this point, and sometimes I don't, but I always remember it the next morning.",1
ptsd,“How do you know?” I’ve been at lower points in my life.,1
ptsd,it's not the drugs i need.,1

ptsd,"I have PTSD, and have for about 15 years with varying degrees of symptom severity after a sexual assault.",1
ptsd,Largely I am only dealing with nightmares and a heightened startle response and doing really well overall.,1
ptsd,"I grew up in an abusive home for years, and it wasn't until my mid 20's that I began come to terms with how subtly that had affected me over the years.",1
ptsd,"I remember after I had explained my traumas and symptoms to my current therapist, I asked her if I it was true that I had something wrong with me (my psychiatrist had told me the week prior that much of what I was experiencing aligned with the PTSD diagnosis and I was startled).",1
ptsd,"Shell shocked, I told my mom about it in the car and she made it very clear to me how there was no way in her mind that it could be that serious.",1
ptsd,I'm just saying my frustrations out into the void.,1
ptsd,"Since this happened i've become introverted, i don't particularly like anyone (because unfortunately, i now tend to focus on the bad side in people), and i attempt to not get past small talk.",1
ptsd,"I started freaking out, went to the hospital because I couldn't breath.",1
ptsd,Occasionally I still feel anxiety when alone and bored at my house.,1
ptsd,My depression is now not a problem at all but the legacy it left is annoying.,1
ptsd,I feel so terrible being honest about that evil summer but recognizing my post traumatic stress makes me so happy.,1
ptsd,"I don't think my childhood was exceptional, just frustrating.",1
ptsd,The traumatic event was when I was forced to take it by friends when I was severely ill and could have used a nine-one-one call instead.,1

ptsd,I've been through sooo much for so long.,1
ptsd,"Acid isn’t for all, and I didn’t take it for a fucking therapy session—but, here I am sat down in front of paper and pastels on a wood floor, not thinking about whatever happened to me however long ago.",1
ptsd,Plus I know filing a claim at the VA is humiliating and I don’t want to go though what others I fear have.,1
ptsd,"And 2) I kind of want to tell the most recent guy that him confessing that to me made me uncomfortable, but I don't know if I should or not.",1
ptsd,"We started having sex, and right off the bat I could tell this was weird.",1
ptsd,"2) I feel safer to wear a heavy coat at work, I know it looks unprofessional and my boss constantly asks me to take it off.",1
ptsd,I have a situation where I am not sure what advice to give.,1
ptsd,"She has BPD or something much like it, and can become very emotional, begin panicking about the potential of abandonment, and threatening suicide, to cut of all her hair etc.",1
ptsd,"During the pregnancy and after the birth (traumatic) of our first child in 2013, symptoms began to intensify, including a lot of depression, manic behaviour and periodic outbreaks of anger.",1
ptsd,I haven't seen her in six and a half years.,1
ptsd,"According to the messages of injury they received from their attackers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame of being ""defective"" or ""not good enough"".",1
ptsd,I don't blame her at all for this behavior but I really need help understanding her before I get hurt worse than I already have.,1

ptsd,I feel like I'm starting to regain control of my life slowly.,1
ptsd,"I asked my doctor to lower my Effexor because I feel like the side effects outweigh the good he does: it doesn't really help my anxiety, I feel depersonalised since I'm on medication and finally it gives me uncontrollable desires.",1
ptsd,"I didn't think that talking about anything would affect my bipolar disorder, and I **really** didn't want to talk about my trauma.",1

ptsd,I'm pretty broke and almost all my money for now goes towards bills and food.,1
ptsd,"It's crazy how DEEP these emotional scars and injuries are, that I literally wept much harder in this session, than in the treatment even waking up in a hospital bald!",1

ptsd,"So on top of my ""doom"" to my gloom..I am now f'n worried about my heart.",1

ptsd,"And I address it immediately because this is the 4th time I have told him not to do these things, then my other friend who is driving nearly gets into an collision with another car i think because he was high on marijuana and the friend we are moving in the backseat is like ""you have to understand I was just trying to get your attention"" you know the thing 5 year olds do to get peoples attention by smacking them, this guy is in his 60's.",1

ptsd,"I have PTSD from my sexual abuse, and this week has been really hard.",1

ptsd,"When I was a kid, I suffered a kind of unlikely injury that basically ruined me mentally, and it seems like I just CAN NOT get away from it, because it's such cheap gory shock value that everyone uses it when they need cheap gory shock value.",1
ptsd,And if I'm not mentally prepared to see it I have a panic attack or just start crying.,1

ptsd,Every day I wake up doing nothing.,1
ptsd,"Absolutely nothing except wasting my life, hoping something would happen but of course nothing would happen because I am a lonely fuck who pushes away everyone in his life while everyone else goes out and party like there is no tomorrow and fuck and cum like they are in a porno and make memories that not even one memory book is enough.",1
ptsd,Every day I wake up doing nothing.,1

ptsd,I am quite annoyed by all the assumptions/game playing/projecting that goes on in the world.,1
ptsd,But I still froze and cried through the entire thing.,1
ptsd,"Some of the sensations brouvht me to memories of old sensations, andI felt really vulnerable, trapped, and ashamed, and I haven't been able to shake it off all day.",1
ptsd,"Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling.",1
ptsd,"In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family.",1

ptsd,"Panic attacks, ruminating, depression, anger, the whole deal.",1
ptsd,The silent sadness that you feel for no apparent reason yet somehow you feel too weak or too much of a pussy to do anything about it or even think that you deserve better because you feel like you deserve whatever painful feeling you are going through You feel like you rather suffer a long and painful life rather than ending your life because you feel like you deserve whatever agony you are going through The anxiety and panic attack come and go whenever they please.,1

ptsd,Just sounds weird.,1

ptsd,"I left after the shower but when I got home, I broke down.",1
ptsd,"Kinda interesting how even when I’m not feeling awful, tiredness still makes me ruminate and feel angry.",1
ptsd,I wonder if it’s the biological sleepiness or if it’s kinda a pavlovian response because I’m so used to having terrible feelings when I sleep?,1
ptsd,Because i feel like nothing i do isn't even worthy of being considered a success.,1

ptsd,It's really disappointing that other students in my class can't seem to grasp the concept of PTSD in people who aren't veterans.,1

ptsd,After she told me about it in the morning I feel like pure shit.,1

ptsd,I'm too unstable.,1
ptsd,I feel so hopeless.,1
ptsd,How am I supposed to feel safe?,1
ptsd,So I have ptsd from an abusive relationship I ended about 3 years ago.,1
ptsd,I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night.,1
ptsd,Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.,1

ptsd,When anyone gets too close to me or accidentally touches me I freak out.,1
ptsd,Tonight I went to a concert and I was so self-conscious and distracted by the fear that I was going to be assaulted that it was difficult to focus on the actual show.,1
ptsd,At night I hear the sound and burst into tears and calm down until I hear it again and start crying.,1
ptsd,I didn’t know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but I’m beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it.,1
ptsd,I feel guilty for this indulgence and feel like maybe I am just looking for attention.,1
ptsd,I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?,1
ptsd,"My last attempt was at a hospital, just a few days ago, but I lied and told them it was my anxiety that led me to self-harm.",1
ptsd,I never thought I’d be in a situation like that in my life and the screaming and blood and chaos following it is just on a constant repeat in my head that won’t stop.,1
ptsd,I had to give 4 separate statements to the police which burned it from start to finish in my brain and it doesn’t stop.,1
ptsd,I don’t know if that’s just because it was less than 24 hours ago and I’m still just in shock?,1
ptsd,It’s just a lot to take in right now  and I’m not sure what to do.,1
ptsd,I apologize for any formatting issues because I’m on mobile/ sounding incoherent I’m just kind of numb after all this and unsure what to do.,1

ptsd,"I think my present anxieties/self image issues stem from traumatic experiences, but I can talk about these things fairly openly in a way that feels rehearsed.",1
ptsd,"I had a panic attack where I felt terrified and unable to move at my psych's this past Tuesday, but that's not typical for me, at least not anymore?",1
ptsd,"I realized most my recent ""panic attacks"" may be ""breakdowns"" because it's not accompanied by a sense of fear, but pent up emotions I haven't been able to release resulting in a sudden loss of control...",1
ptsd,"I start hyperventilating, screaming, and unleash all this pent up fury to the point where I feel detached from my emotions/self and have no control, start throwing things or hurting myself, until I'm exhausted and suddenly shut down/dissociate.",1
ptsd,"For me, that doesn't HELP AT ALL.",1
ptsd,"It just makes me feel like I'm just pissing him off, and my problem has suddenly become his, minimizing my emotions about it?",1
ptsd,"He always says I need to be protected, but he doesn't understand that it's not an imminent threat in my life anymore, but a constant struggle and disability; that my brain works and processes things differently now and always will.",1
ptsd,I just feel so very alone when I talk to him.,1
ptsd,"i never really knew people gave a shit about me, and it really meant a lot to me; it still does.",1
ptsd,"but if so many people are here for me, and things are going to be okay, why am i still afraid of them?",1
ptsd,why do i still have a pit in my stomach and why are these thoughts still clawing at the sides of my skull?,1
ptsd,why am i crying right now?,1
ptsd,"i don't understand it, i don't understand my own brain and i feel like an ungrateful prick for still being shaken up so badly.",1
ptsd,"I don't need coddling or protecting, I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out, or help me through a flashback.",1
ptsd,"Everytime I have had a breakdown, and try to express things from the past, he audibly growls and talks about how pissed he is that it happened.",1

ptsd,I recently went through an event that was extremely traumatic.,1
ptsd,It's been less than a week and not even sure what I'm dealing with here but all I know is that I feel like I am being discouraged from getting help.,1
ptsd,"It’s becoming cyclical for me, where I “retreat” and revise and then feel like I need to retrigger myself to avoid slipping back into denial that it happened the way it happened.",1
ptsd,I can’t live like this.,1
ptsd,My therapist is away for a month and this means I have no one to push me to deal with this thing.,1
ptsd,I don’t know what to do.,1
ptsd,It’s really kind of ruining my ability to empathize with some people Bc of comments they’ve made in the past.,1
ptsd,I witnessed the attempted suicide of my sister and then subsequent self harm targeting just towards myself for the purpose of manipulation and dealt with no one believing that it happened.,1
ptsd,"So many people have told me be happy it was a failed attempt, failing to recognize the damage knowing someone I love could want to hurt me so badly did.",1
ptsd,Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that.,1
ptsd,And then I just want it to go away.,1
ptsd,"I dont know what to do about this, I feel like the world doesn't want me to talk about it.",1
ptsd,It's to uncomfortable for people...,1
ptsd,But I hate these feelings and they are just the tip of the iceburg that is ptsd.,1
ptsd,I felt like I needed to say something somwhere though.,1
ptsd,He got flustered really easily or would get angry over something simple—traffic or a common life situation.,1
ptsd,"He seems to have no patience anymore, especially with me and will just shut down.",1
ptsd,It would take until my mid-twenties before I stopped letting people hurt me.,1
ptsd,I've been out of therapy for almost 10 years but my coping mechanisms have been failing.,1
ptsd,I'm having breakdown after breakdown after the slightest trigger and there are SO MANY triggers!,1
ptsd,"I saw a professional for a psych evaluation and though there are no flashbacks or nightmares, I still am placed with the ptsd label.",1
ptsd,"I know this isn’t something you just “get over” I just thought I moved on from my “trauma” I watched a few episodes of bojack horseman and it’s thrown me into an episode of depression Idk I’m sad, I’m mad, I get irritable I have no idea what symptoms and triggers are for me, I just keep going because if I don’t I’ll stop and fall apart.",1
ptsd,I would’ve rather been told I’m a sociopath/psychopath or a narcissist due to my severe apathy towards everything.,1
ptsd,"My siblings would cry whenever they didn’t get what they wanted, they were rather spoiled, and would tell on me if I didn’t do what they wanted.",1
ptsd,Mom would be in the middle of homework or class and she’d just wail on me for no reason.,1
ptsd,"I cannot move, even though I am fully aware I am standing in the door.",1
ptsd,Do I force myself to move forward?,1
ptsd,Am I being ridiculous because I still have ptsd?,1
ptsd,I feel like they’re so out of line.,1
ptsd,I’m all over the place.,1
ptsd,As a result I had a total burn out.,1
ptsd,My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people.,1
ptsd,It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all.,1
ptsd,It's not really safe for me to be driving.,1
ptsd,I can't even function enough to do the grocery shopping.,1
ptsd,"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often.",1
ptsd,My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).,1
ptsd,I am afraid of anything and everything at the same time I am afraid of what happened or what may happen.,1
ptsd,"I am afraid the world, the earth, the skies, the stars, aliens, humans, animals, whatever fucking bullshit thought that had occurred in my head that makes my skin crawl.",1
ptsd,I am afraid of what I am or what I might become.,1
ptsd,"I am afraid that I might go crazy or fight that I might become boring, or normal, or average, or weird, or some fucking hippie, or some fucking stupid hard-headed person.",1
ptsd,I'm finally at the place in my counselling where my therapist and I both think I'm ready to work through it.,1
ptsd,"Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger, and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore, and my body felt all weird and flat, my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule, my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it.",1
ptsd,Things got better in middle school (thankfully) but it’s sad how literally 5 years as a young child (when life was supposed to be good) were so rough and still affect my life to this day.,1
ptsd,My home life wasn’t super bad but school was a living hell.,1
ptsd,I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting.,1
ptsd,Bullying in elementary school directly caused so many of my mental health issues.,1
ptsd,"And I’ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can’t breathe I’m shaking I’m numb.",1
ptsd,I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive.,1
ptsd,My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day.,1
ptsd,My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents.,1
ptsd,I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it.,1
ptsd,"It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either.",1
ptsd,"), but my PTSD symptoms are loud.",1
ptsd,"I'm not sleeping, my self harm has escalated and I'm struggling to leave my house.",1
ptsd,I'm also just about to lose my job because the company I work for is going under.,1
ptsd,"but when it was happening, I felt only halfway there.",1
ptsd,"and now my memory of it is hazy, and when I try to think about it I don't see it from my perspective, I see it from like above me.",1
ptsd,like it wasn't *actually*happening to me.,1
ptsd,The past few nights I have been drifting off to sleep and then I get the sensation that I'm falling and jerk awake.,1
ptsd,"I've had it happen before to me, but never like 50 times in a row that prevents me from sleeping.",1
ptsd,Like fucking why?,1
ptsd,"But I do not even think the therapist is supposed to actually care, she actually seems to, but I cannot understand it.",1
ptsd,"I did not start therapy because I thought she would care, I started therapy because I jumped off a bridge 1 year ago and I have an 18 and 21 year old brother and sister who are too young to process a suicide, it would be wrong, so therapy is the thing I figured.",1
ptsd,"But another part of me feels tied down these days, I am getting tired of this town and want to pick up my pack and go on down that open road just as I have 16 times in these past 15 years and she is the only reason I don't.",1
ptsd,"It feels great, but I'm worried.",1
ptsd,I tried to kill myself one year and one month ago.,1
ptsd,I am prone to depression.,1
ptsd,"I am worried about crashing too hard, and I have kids to care for.",1
ptsd,I started to get depressed but was personally unaware.,1
ptsd,"My wife started to notice that I wasn't eating, was moody, not sleeping, and laying in bed all day.",1
ptsd,She asked me if I was ok and I... broke down.,1
ptsd,All emotions came to a tipping point and I started whaling in tears.,1
ptsd,I told her I had been thinking about suicide.,1
ptsd,I can't decide if it's healthy or not since most of the traumatic things that happened at home were in that space.,1
ptsd,"I'll find myself camped out, sobbing on the floor, but can't really pinpoint why it's the place I always seek out.",1
ptsd,"Secondly; if it's not helping me recover, how can I make the rest of my house more appealing?",1
ptsd,It sucks.,1
ptsd,I know I need help.,1
ptsd,I want to get help.,1
ptsd,"I was sexually abused throughout my childhood (at least 10 years, possibly longer).",1
ptsd,I forgot the memories for a long time but now I'm finally getting them back and it's freaking me out.,1
ptsd,My sleep patterns are erratic because I don't want to sleep anymore.,1
ptsd,Is it normal to have PTSD with nightmares EVERY time I sleep?,1
ptsd,My psychologist has started trying to slowly desensitize me by showing me pictures and videos of what disturbs me: this is currently making things worse.,1
ptsd,And my nightmares are a terrifying mix of intense body horror and trauma flashbacks.,1
ptsd,So I wake up even more tired and in pain which makes me miserable during the day.,1
ptsd,"So now I'm having my chronic pain flaring up, my other PTSD symptoms kicking my ass, my other mental illnesses acting up, and on top of that I'm too tired from the nightmares to do anything about it.",1
ptsd,I just can't fucking win.,1
ptsd,I'm so so tired.,1
ptsd,"Hi everybody, I'm a 22 year old male who has had extreme depression and anxiety issues since I was 12 years old.",1
ptsd,I was also a competitive swimmer growing up and these issues started flaring up when I was moved into an age group with a very strict and demanding groups.,1
ptsd,I had swam maybe one meet before getting placed into this group and was completely overwhelmed.,1
ptsd,And I’m scared all the time.,1
ptsd,"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories.",1
ptsd,And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating.,1
ptsd,I’m sorry.,1
ptsd,I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,1
ptsd,"my abuser is in my family, and i am in the process of healing but every family reunion/holiday i must see my abuser causing me to enter panic attacks, constant crying, and flashbacks, causing an uproar to what could make me so ""troubled"" I am afraid of coming out to my family in case of being removed for my family forever and damaging relationships.",1
ptsd,I have younger family members i am trying to protect so i feel alot of weight on my shoulders when i am having a bad PTSD episode around my abuser and my younger family members.,1
ptsd,Also there was an attempted rape on me when I was 21.,1
ptsd,I never realised how much an effect these events had on me.,1
ptsd,I grew up believing that everything bad that happened was my fault.,1
ptsd,"I have tried so hard to make something of my life after that hell, but now that everything feels like falling apart again I feel like I am breaking.",1
ptsd,"I feel like I'm not even allowed to feel like this, because I deserve this hard life.",1
ptsd,"I don’t have anything to ask atm or anything that anyone else need to know, but i cant go to someone when I’m not coping or in a state, I feel like it’s something I have to ride out on my own, that I can’t tell anyone about.",1
ptsd,"I hate going throw this on my own, not that my family don’t try to support me, I just don’t want to see mum cry again because I’m broken and she’s tryed every thing she can but nothing helps.",1
ptsd,"Iv had more 5 therapist and seen at least that again in one off meeting, but I can’t engage and have developed a vague phobia towards them, I used to hide in the house when I knew I had an appointment and only come out if I was promised I didn’t have to go.",1
ptsd,I can’t see my condition changing.,1
ptsd,I suffer from PTSD because I have been abused my entire life.,1
ptsd,I was physically abused by my teacher when I was 8 years old.,1
ptsd,"My mother physically, mentally and emotionally abused me, up until I left her house at 16.",1
ptsd,"It hurts, every day.",1
ptsd,"Not all the time, but usually when I'm upset or having a hard time.",1
ptsd,It'd be nice to know the pain isn't all in my head and maybe it's actually a physical consequence.,1
ptsd,It just hurts.,1
ptsd,I can't help but feel so guilty for doing so.,1
ptsd,I am just nervous and very scared.,1
ptsd,"But there is no certainty, and I am so scared I am going to fuck this up.",1
ptsd,But none of that seems meaningful in the dead of night when I cannot sleep and get so sad and ruminating.,1
ptsd,I just do not know what to do to improve it or fix it.,1
ptsd,"I grab my partner and told him “ we need to get out of here right fucking now!” We made hour way out of the building, as we were exiting the conditions increasingly got worse, just as we made the door the room flashover, my partner was already in the hallway I was still in the room.",1
ptsd,After that I started struggling with anxiety at work and home.,1
ptsd,On my days off I started to drink excessively.,1
ptsd,I'm currently almost 19 but suffered a lot of traumatic events within my immediate family between the ages of 10-15.,1
ptsd,"This was obviously accompanied by some unbearable anxiety, as well as very severe panic attacks.",1
ptsd,"I didn't tell anyone, not even my family.",1
ptsd,"They didn't know, they didnt know because they couldn't know.",1
ptsd,I can't stop feeling miserable.,1
ptsd,"It's not even because my ex is going crazy, because he's once again proven I don't get to control my own life.",1
ptsd,I can't let go of the prosecutor telling me I only hear what I want.,1
ptsd,"I don't even know what he was referring to, but it has to be true because I honestly don't remember agreeing to dismiss he case.",1
ptsd,"I'm guess I'm not doing as well as I thought, and I must be as crazy as I now feel.",1
ptsd,"I mentioned I was blocking the signs, she asked why and I said, well, I feel they are kind of negative... And then she told me ""They aren't negative, they are funny, and since you don't think so you should think on if you even want to work here"", walks away and proceeds to tell my boss it isn't working out with me........ all because I expressed that I felt the signs were negative.",1
ptsd,Self-esteem hit new lows and had already felt really humiliated about assault before and wanted to tell friends to stop feeling so bad about it and to be able to talk to someone on days when my PTSD got really bad.,1
ptsd,"But now I feel even more humiliated about it and feel like anyone that knows is going to see me as damaged, so theres a lot of shame.",1
ptsd,I'm also terrified to talk to anyone else about it.,1
ptsd,"However because I was so young (high school/college), people have disregarded the validity of my abuse- which results in me hiding it from the world.",1
ptsd,"That sucks, but it's not as bad as what it does to me.",1
ptsd,"On top of crippling anxiety about everyday life, I have a terrible fear of commitment that I didn't realize I had until I moved in with my current boyfriend.",1
ptsd,"And when I came out of this ""blackout"" I was really groggy and anxious.",1
ptsd,I’m struggling to figure out what’s wrong with me at the moment.,1
ptsd,"I’m slightly annoyed because before all of this she’s been taking me very seriously and helping with so much, and now I feel like she’s being demeaning?",1
ptsd,But I wish I could find a place where it isn't so dark.,1
ptsd,"I can't tell if i'm becoming worse, because I did EMDR on my bad drug experiences and feel great now.",1
ptsd,"The rest of what i'm dealing with is early childhood trauma, which was prolonged so i'm thinking EMDR is just bringing out these feelings and making my body become very unhappy since im reprogramming it to not constantly be hyper aware and anxious.",1
ptsd,Ive had a few hospital visits because after some sessions i turn into a hypochondriac because the physical responses are so odd.,1
ptsd,One session made the left side of my face numb.,1
ptsd,I need quiet and darkness to recover from a major trigger like that.,1
ptsd,"We had left the radio on in the bedroom and it was blaring so loudly, but I couldn't move I just needed to sit for a little bit.",1
ptsd,I can't go anywhere without and inhaler and I tested positive for asthma even though I've never had an issue before all this happened.,1
ptsd,I don't know what to do.,1
ptsd,I feel like I should go to get psychiatric help but now that I'm in college and only working part time I'm scared of not being able to pay the doctor bills.,1
ptsd,I don't know what to do.,1
ptsd,I’m really tired.,1
ptsd,I get triggered and I have to start all over again.,1
ptsd,It’s so hard to see the point in fighting all of this all the time.,1
ptsd,I still live with my abuser and sometimes I can make it.,1

ptsd,I can't remember what was in the marital home when I left.,1
ptsd,"I am still piecing together weird, incongruous chunks of time, flashbacks, disjointed memories, and trying to figure out what happened; it seems like my brain just can't access specific details when I'd like it to.",1
ptsd,"The problem here, other than everything, is that I don't feel like my attorney gets why I'm such a useless participant right now, and I could use some advice on explaining it.",1
ptsd,My depression/anxiety has been building over the past 3 months after a long remission period and due to current circumstances has nearly swung full steam over my everyday life.,1
ptsd,"I have the scars, medical records, injuries, memories, and nightmares.",1
ptsd,I know it's caused me to suffer from CPTSD.,1
ptsd,But has it caused me to lose my mind?,1
ptsd,I can't remember agreeing to dismiss.,1
ptsd,night sweats (bed stinks so bad and I have to wash the sheets daily and my bedroom is 68 degrees and I only sleep with sheets.),1
ptsd,night terrors (re-occuring dream: waking up with the feeling that I am supposed to tell someone something to prevent an awful occurrence from happening but unable to say the words.,1
ptsd,The words just won't come out) Wife scared to wake me up because I am fearfully jumpy and suffer from panic attacks upon awaking.,1
ptsd,I can't be having PTSD from something as mild as what happened even though I have pretty much all the symptoms.,1
ptsd,I feel I'm just lying to myself.,1
ptsd,I probably just want attention.,1
ptsd,"I feel like a huge fraud... How am I even supposed to ""heal"" when I'm probably making everything up, I'm probably not broken, I'm just going to get yelled at again at the new therapy place like my last one because I'll be mute every session (don't even know why, I tell myself ""because I'm not ready to talk about it"" but it's been over 5 years since the last case and all this crap is minor, so it's probably just being ashamed over doing all this crap for god-knows-why when barely anything happened to me...), because ""I'm not trying"".",1
ptsd,"I don't even know why I'm posting this, probably just begging for more attention, I've pushed the last true friend I had away a few days ago over my fears of therapy.",1
ptsd,"My memory goes, I panic, breakdown, rock back and forth, sit in closets.",1
ptsd,It sucks.,1
ptsd,But it's kind of relieving at the same time because while I'm broken I'm not choosing to be dramatic.,1
ptsd,I was sexually abused when I was a kid and I suspect that I have PTSD because of it.,1
ptsd,"I've never been diagnosed with PTSD, but I have been diagnosed with agoraphobia.",1

ptsd,It's really hurting.,1
ptsd,I just don't want to hurt anyone but I know deep down that it's me that's hurt.,1
ptsd,I really don't know what's wrong with me lately.,1
ptsd,It seems like every day I'm having some kind of meltdown and I don't know how to get back to normal.,1
ptsd,"The other night I had a massive flashback, no idea what triggered it.",1
ptsd,And for about two weeks now I feel constantly on the verge of an anxiety attack.,1
ptsd,I was a severe addict that had 2 overdoses when I was younger and addiction/alcoholism runs on both sides of my family.,1
ptsd,I don't want to come out of on the other side and be this nervous and uncomfortable person who is unable to have relationships.,1
ptsd,"I have been thinking of seeing a therapist, I don't really have the time or extra money, plus I've been really hurt from small intimate AA groups.... Ugh.... Is there another side of this PTSD mental attrition?",1
ptsd,"I'm not ready to talk about what happened, but it was pretty recent so even the small things are triggering.",1
ptsd,"I'm getting help, but these things take time and I can't just quit the internet.",1
ptsd,But it seems like I'm also dealing with abandonment issues with my parents which has recently reemerged after coming out as transgender which they don't support.,1
ptsd,"Unfortunately, I have Lyme disease and live with them because I'm too sick to do anything and they won't support my transition.",1
ptsd,I get the feeling that if I was healthy and I transitioned I'd never speak to them.,1
ptsd,But I mean does it really matter?,1
ptsd,I didn't know that either but I still felt the same.,1
ptsd,Also that whole living situation and that man was horrible and stressful anyway (without it being a trigger for something else too).,1
ptsd,Why did I open my mouth I should’ve just said “I’m fine” ~ I don’t need help Or maybe I do,1
ptsd,I really don't want to talk about what happened.,1
ptsd,"But, I really want the nightmares to go away.",1
ptsd,"Sorry if this sounds weird, I am really really fucking tired...",1
ptsd,I have complex ptsd due to past romantic relationships and some other various traumas in my life.,1

ptsd,I am terribly upset because this is the first partner to really take me as I am (dark side and all) The paranoid feeling that things are going to end has made it almost inevitable.,1
ptsd,"But now, I can't.",1
ptsd,I have completely given up on getting the correct mental health treatment.,1
ptsd,Even after he finished the exam he did another sweep with his hand idk wtf he was checking because we were all done I’m almost positive he just wanted to fucking touch me because every chance he could he would.,1
ptsd,"I was so close to tears I know this isn’t like so bad, but to a girl with ptsd from assault it was the end of the world.",1
ptsd,I felt so gross and grimy having his nasty hands on me calling me beautiful.,1
ptsd,"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories.",1
ptsd,And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating.,1
ptsd,I’m sorry.,1
ptsd,I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,1
ptsd,I know my thoughts are disorganized right now and I’m finding it hard to organize them.,1
ptsd,"“Fuck it, I’ll just microwave those fuckers and then give myself the decency to have a painless death.” “Ok ok, deep breaths.",1
ptsd,That completely threw me.,1
ptsd,I don't know why I'm finding it so difficult to cope.,1
ptsd,I'm crying frequently for some reason and I don't know why.,1
ptsd,I haven't done the whole uncontrollable crying thing since my last episode which was all the way back in November 2016.,1
ptsd,"I know he's never going to be the same, but it's hard seeing him like this.",1
ptsd,My brother lashes out when things don't go his way to and just has a nasty attitude at times..,1
ptsd,My family was never like that growing up.,1
ptsd,"Until recent years, I rarely got hugs from parents or my brother and when we'd brush legs while sitting, it'd be an awkward ""oh sorry"" and a shuffle to separate.",1
ptsd,I feel so worthless on those days.,1
ptsd,"I had PTSD for almost a year before going on benzos, but it wasn't until I was put on benzos (and then stupidly chose to continue a do-it-yourself habit) that my mind just happily dissociated - I barely remember the last year.",1
ptsd,What in the fuck have I done to myself?,1
ptsd,My husband had several things happen to him when he was a teenager and occasionally when things get very bad for him he has very bad flashbacks complete with regression to the time when the trauma happened.,1
ptsd,"It is heartbreaking to see, and obviously he does not recognize me and does not understand why we live together and why he’s not living at his parents house Does anyone have experience with this kind of flashbacks?",1
ptsd,I am constantly afraid of when it's going to happen next and I'm so scared I'm going to have some embarrassing reaction to it.,1
ptsd,It happened today and I was able to play it cool for about 5 minutes and then I went on my lunch and cried my eyes out in my car.,1
ptsd,I've been having really bad flashbacks all afternoon and night.,1
ptsd,I really wish it didn't get to me like this.,1
ptsd,I've wanted to kill myself almost everyday for 17 years.,1
ptsd,I'm done talking to therapists and asking friends for help.,1
ptsd,Right now I see two options: commit suicide or develop an emergency self-care plan for when I'm feeling this way so I'll be okay until I feel safe again.,1
ptsd,I'm afraid that maybe they aren't true and I'm demonizing him in my memory because having a villain that did horrible things to me is just easier to digest than the complicated truth.,1
ptsd,"The worst thing is, I can't bring myself to talk to anybody.",1
ptsd,I always felt like I wasn't bad enough to need a doctor.,1
ptsd,I felt like I could get through it on my own.,1
ptsd,"Even now, its hard for me to open up to my fiance about these things.",1
ptsd,I'm not very good at expressing my emotions.,1
ptsd,I was molested multiple times by my biological dad when I was 5 up until middle school (so like 10 yrs old).,1
ptsd,"After many times in the past telling my mom that my dad had ""touched me weird"" my mom had gotten annoyed and mad at me.",1
ptsd,He denied it and ever since then I think everyone is out to get me and that nothing ever happened and I'm just insane.,1
ptsd,I always doubt myself and it's hard to hang out with anyone because I think they all have some agenda toward me.,1
ptsd,I know logically nothing happened but when I get home I have to always check my body for bruises or anything suspicious.,1
ptsd,Then I feel shameful and want to self harm/die when I realize I'm accusing someone innocent of something so terrible and then my mind tells me nothing ever happened and I'm just nuts.,1
ptsd,It doesn't help that my family doesn't understand me and minimalizes all of my problems.,1
ptsd,I came out of that appointment in tears.,1
ptsd,That was a horrible day and I still think about it.,1
ptsd,It made me feel like I had nothing to complain about.,1
ptsd,Its only taken me until the last couple of weeks to finally accept that I did nothing wrong.,1

ptsd,"Sorry for the long post, I don’t have anyone to talk to about this until January when I see my therapist next.",1
ptsd,I am constantly freaking out and unable to see friends that don't know about my diagnosis or make the friends that do feel very uncomfortable.,1
ptsd,I feel guilty because I feel as if I brought this all on myself because if I hadn't of taunted my father he would not have attacked me.,1
ptsd,I know rationally this is not true but I cannot shake the feeling.,1
ptsd,The guilt is eating me up.,1
ptsd,"I was diagnosed with PTSD after I was assaulted when I was 18, but to be honest I've never really felt like I had it.",1
ptsd,I can usually push things down so deeply that I don't feel many repercussions of what I've been through aside from a lot of shame.,1
ptsd,"In the last 4 months though, someone who's been on and off harassing me since I was 17 has resurfaced.",1
ptsd,"He was sending me hundreds of texts and calling me saying things varying from ""you're going to marry me and we can have kids and live together forever"" to ""you're a whore and you're a disgusting person and I want to (insert threat) you"".",1
ptsd,Matches up with my ex-wife’s thoughts that I don’t sleep more than 30 min before coughing myself awake and throwing fists.,1
ptsd,"-I don't have any relief in my symptoms and am concerned that I've wasted an entire year of my life I'm concerned that I not leave this relationship too soon, but at the same time, I'm paying for this therapy, I have repeatedly brought up questions about goals in my sessions, and don't feel like this is the right fit...unless I need to open up more.",1
ptsd,"I asked one of the cops what was going on a few times before the words ""Child Pornography"" dropped out of his mouth like a fucking anvil in my gut.",1
ptsd,"I didn't say anything, I could not comprehend that it was really happening.",1
ptsd,I've been through some shit in my life but I've never experienced the level of total bewilderment and unreality that I did when I realized the FBIs Crimes Against Children unit was raiding me for kiddie porn.,1
ptsd,He said that I should have ptsd because the reason I was wrestling my dad for the gun is because Im a sick bastard who wanted to kill him and the rest of my family.,1
ptsd,I don't know why I made this post.,1
ptsd,I don't know if I even really got out what I wanted to say.,1
ptsd,I just feel so alone.,1

ptsd,"This is something where I know it happened, and I can remember time after time how it had happened.",1

ptsd,I wish I wouldn't think about it.,1
ptsd,It's like I get some sick thrill out of the fear and anxiety like it's a horror movie or rollercoaster.,1

ptsd,There is so much I can't do because I don't drive and it has impacted my life in such a way that it feels like I am in my own personal prison.,1
ptsd,I have been to therapy but it doesn't seem to work.,1
ptsd,I do have intense anxiety to the point it affects my daily life and prevents me from performing the smallest tasks such as making a phone call to get an appointment.,1
ptsd,"However, I do not know if my anxiety is a result from what had happened to me as a child or me experiencing unpleasant experiences in highschool.",1
ptsd,I just know that my rape makes my anxiety worse sometimes.,1
ptsd,I do get triggered by anything that reminds me of unpleasant memories of my rape.,1
ptsd,The only time I break down is when I am severely distressed or my feelings are so bottled up that a trigger would set me off crying.,1
ptsd,"I had another friend come out and tap on my window, scaring me.",1
ptsd,"He didn’t know what happened, and when he asked me what was wrong I just started to cry.",1
ptsd,I felt stupid and ashamed.,1
ptsd,"Through the sobs I told him what happened, I even told him that my rapists did it to me.",1
ptsd,He was supportive and sweet and it made me feel so much more guilty.,1
ptsd,"Hi, I cannot think clearly today.",1
ptsd,"I know I have to take care of myself, but its always been an issue.",1
ptsd,I literally felt her lose interest in talking to me as I said that.,1
ptsd,This was only my second time meeting her and we never delved into any of the main issues that I was facing but she brushed me off so quickly all because I wasn't sobbing my eyes out or felf like committing suicide.,1
ptsd,"Here comes a little rant, because I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m done with it.",1
ptsd,I keep on having panic attacks and I can’t find the trigger.,1
ptsd,"I’ve been crying for hours now, and yesterday and the day before as well.",1
ptsd,"I’m seriously afraid that I will go nuts one day, I see no end nor a solution.",1
ptsd,I’m afraid I’ll end up in a mental hospital.,1
ptsd,"My friend made a comment that really embarrassed me because, up until that point, I hadn't realized how unusual it probably appeared.",1
ptsd,"I know I never did this before, so I'm wondering if it has anything to do with what happened to me.",1
ptsd,I feel like I'm the only one.,1
ptsd,"I've stopped telling it,  and when someone at work says what's wrong.",1
ptsd,I just look at them and say its been a day.,1
ptsd,I just can't really go out and do stuff.,1
ptsd,I keep pushing college back I wanted to be a nurse and now I don't want to do anything but be a hermit and go live in the woods.,1
ptsd,"I'm not really looking for responses I'm just tired of people not listening or believing me, I've had it all my life and I'm just done with it.",1
ptsd,"In February of this year, I was raped by my (now ex) boyfriend, who also happened to be the only person I've ever had sex with.",1
ptsd,I was diagnosed with PTSD in September.,1
ptsd,"The rape has flipped my life entirely upside down, and there isn't an hour that goes by where my mind doesn't screw me over with either thoughts of the rape itself or simply just HIM.",1
ptsd,And I don't even remember.,1
ptsd,But my brain defaulted into my stoned embarrassment.,1
ptsd,"Just having this idea people hate me when they don’t, missing my dad and punishing myself for not being able to help my dad through his alcoholism.",1
ptsd,"But damn, I felt really inferior.",1
ptsd,"My friends are branching off and doing amazing things, and I feel I’m in the corner just trying to make it through the day, constantly dealing with chronic pain, low immunity, and PTSD.",1
ptsd,I’m just having a rough time tonight.,1
ptsd,I havent seen her since this happened and Im due back at uni next week.,1
ptsd,Now I’m wishing I didn’t.,1
ptsd,"Called two of my friends, but it’s late and they’re asleep.",1
ptsd,I guess I am just sick and tired of my trauma interfering with my relationships.,1
ptsd,I feel bad for my boyfriend- he shouldn't have to put up with this stuff.,1
ptsd,I know he loves me and he is terribly worried.,1
ptsd,But I also feel bad for me.,1
ptsd,"I'm not sure why he thinks I want to erode their relationship, this is another thing I'm still thinking about.",1
ptsd,This is sorta horrifying to think about because I have absolutely zero romantic interest in him at all and the reason I valued our friendship so much in the first place was because there was no romantic/sexual element.,1
ptsd,"I was nice, and it got me no where, so I was rude, it got worse.",1
ptsd,"I compliment my mom and my sister as much as I can, I tell my sister I’m proud of her, I tell both of them I love them, I take care of my mom the best I can, but I’m still their verbal punching bag.",1
ptsd,"Every day I tell my mom that I love her, that she looks pretty, etc etc, but it ends up in her replying with “you’re gonna fail this year you know that right?",1
ptsd,My sister called me naive and immature for not making fun of people’s interests and looks.,1
ptsd,Please don't make me feel worse.,1
ptsd,"I mean, hell, I'm ashamed I even need to ask my boyfriend.",1
ptsd,My mom and sister either do nothing or make it worse.,1
ptsd,"My father would abuse me consistently both mentally and physically from i think 4 to 14, maybe earlier.",1
ptsd,"I don't really remember what all brought this on, but often it was school related.",1
ptsd,"I remember being in a car seat, my mother didn't know what to do so she took me to him (my parents are apart), and i tried to run because i knew what was going to happen, and i remember crying so hard i hyperventilated, my mom promised never to do that again.",1
ptsd,"And I freak out when staff at the library call cops over us ""being loud"", I freak out over some very minor warrants.",1
ptsd,"im so scared of everything around me, whenever I have a panic attack, I can't even call out for help, I just choke on my own breath and cry im just fearful of what's going to happen in the future.",1
ptsd,"I'm already seeing a therapist but i've been relapsing so bad since september and i just don't know what to do it's been such a rollercoaster and it just feels hopeless to recover from this im sorry for bothering you guys i just need to talk.. everyone i can talk to is asleep and i wouldnt be able to talk to them even if I could, i feel so numb after the panic attack i had last night, i just..",1
ptsd,"Need a talk, a distraction or something, because right now I just feel so.",1
ptsd,I don't remember everything but i tried to lie to him and he had to drag me to the bathroom and tried to make me throw up.,1
ptsd,"The scary thing is that when he went to call the ambulance and i thought i just might die i repeated to myself ""It's finally over"".",1
ptsd,I'm soo lucky/blessed that I have parents with an open home to me so that I am able to do this but I can't keep going on like this.,1
ptsd,I feel afraid to work.,1
ptsd,I feel like less of a man because of this.,1
ptsd,I worry about my future and if I'll ever get stable ground.,1
ptsd,"Sorry, I needed to put my thoughts into text.",1
ptsd,"I don't have any point, I'm just overwhelmed and want to give up.",1
ptsd,"I don't want to tell my therapist, I don't want to go to therapy.",1
ptsd,It feels artificial and contrived and uneven.,1
ptsd,It's sick and twisted.,1
ptsd,I've been getting nauseas and I've been having more dissociative flashbacks.,1
ptsd,"My nightmares are coming back, but they're mostly of his parents.",1
ptsd,"I'm afraid to see them, although my dreams are usually them telling me they understand.",1
ptsd,it wasn't my fault it feels like my fault I feel like the reason That mother shouldn't have had to bury her boy I should have been a better friend,1
ptsd,But then i couldn't think straight.,1
ptsd,now i get flashbacks in school.,1
ptsd,"I used to enjoy quantitative courses but now i get tension headaches from the flashbacks, and feelings of horror and hyperarousal.",1
ptsd,I just feel so violated and disturbed that it was for fear of his violence that i didn't close the door - and that he was watching me!,1
ptsd,They got increasingly angry and started calling me selfish for trying to keep them apart.,1
ptsd,Angrily telling me that I need to stop pretending he raped me and how I wanted everything that happened and that I was just a jealous ex.,1
ptsd,"I won't and kinda can't (remember missing pieces of time) go into all the details, but he gaslighted me pretty bad.",1
ptsd,Sometimes I'll stop and just stand somewhere or stare until I get snapped out of it.,1
ptsd,I don't know for how long but it can't be for more than 10 minutes.,1
ptsd,When I dissociate it's usually a lot more violent and delusional so I thought maybe it was something else.,1
ptsd,"I haven't brought it up with my therapist because I just had a meeting with her before learning about this, am I just looking too deep into things?",1
ptsd,I only get it when I have a flashback or strong reaction to a trigger.,1
ptsd,Also been having lots of nightmares again recently.,1
ptsd,"Not sure what to do as I’m not currently in therapy, but I am waiting to be seen at a mental health clinic.",1
ptsd,I go through periods where all night I have nightmares and I can’t slee because of them.,1
ptsd,"Three years ago I used to be on a medicine that helped with the nightmares, I can’t remember the name though.",1
ptsd,But it made me so tired.,1
ptsd,My version of events wasn't believed due to ten other witnesses denying it and I was expelled immediately.,1
ptsd,"I'm waiting to tell work about what happened, that I can't come in.",1
ptsd,I don't care if they're mad or if I get fired.,1
ptsd,I just feel so shaken and scared still.,1
ptsd,I feel like I've taken a giant step back.,1
ptsd,"The subsequent criminal trial has made me question my emotional stability, and memories.",1
ptsd,"Are the symptoms of CPTSD causing me to fail in my interactions on a day to day basis, or has there simply been a bizarre miscommunication?",1
ptsd,I wish I could go back and just not fuck up so horribly.,1
ptsd,I was begged not to go out on this date from tinder.,1
ptsd,My friend was raped off tinder and told me all guys want are sex off tinder.,1
ptsd,I'm so stupid.,1
ptsd,"I'm new to Reddit and have only really discussed my issues with trauma and PTSD with my partner and therapist, and I am struggling with the random dissociative cycles of derealization and depersonalization.",1
ptsd,And I'm so tired of it.,1
ptsd,I've been in therapy for half of my life.,1
ptsd,"I write and also listen to music to help when I'm having issues, but it never feels like enough.",1
ptsd,I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.,1
ptsd,It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion.,1
ptsd,"But things aren’t that easy and than there’s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he, of all people, will change.",1
ptsd,I'm afraid of going into too much detail only because I constantly fear that he knows that I talk about him.,1
ptsd,"To keep it short, my father was physically violent towards me, my mother, our dog, mistreated all of his animals, leaked our information on shady sites before multiple times, and has made my life a living hell up until I went to court to stop having visitation with him.",1
ptsd,"I thought that it wouldn't really affect anything outside of startle reflex, trust issues, etc, but here I am years after my last visit with him and it's still affecting me fucking terribly.",1
ptsd,I just sat in bed sobbing for a half hour because I'm afraid of everyone around me.,1
ptsd,I'm assuming I have PTSD and my work gave me a number to call and I'm debating doing so.,1
ptsd,But I hate asking for help and I feel pathetic because nothing happened.,1
ptsd,I just really need advice because I'm struggling on how to feel.,1
ptsd,I don't know why I can't just brush this off considering I'm alright.,1
ptsd,"However, today I was sitting at work and for whatever reason I started thinking about the knife incident.",1
ptsd,"It was a pretty stupid thing to think about, it caused the worst panic attack I've had in months and had to go for a walk around the block to clear my head.",1
ptsd,I don't want to feel like a burden to anyone anymore and to myself so the feeling of wanting to die didn't go away.,1
ptsd,I don't know how to deal with myself or with other people since I feel like I should just get over it and continue with my life but I can't and I'm 22.,1
ptsd,Am I just so weak that I can't deal with what happened to me that I can't normally continue with my life?,1
ptsd,I feel like I'm at the end of my rope here.,1
ptsd,I bawl every night because I don't want to feel this never ending pain anymore.,1

ptsd,I am currently trying to come up with ways to manage my day to day life.,1
ptsd,But even the ride from home to office is enough to send me into a spin for about an hour.,1
ptsd,"Without my boyfriend who I thought was my best friend, my two female friends who used to always have my back becoming distant, and now not knowing who or what to trust seeing as Nex and I still work in the same industry my PTSD is just skyrocketing off the charts.",1
ptsd,"With no roots put back down yet (which I’m working on the living sit) and no one close to turn to emotionally, how the fuck do I go on?",1
ptsd,I know giving up is not an option but it is all so overwhelming...,1
ptsd,I don't know one other person who goes through shit like this at work or who acts like that - WTF?).,1
ptsd,"They just want to brush it off, and no one gives a shit.",1
ptsd,I tried to do some digging and pin down what I am experiencing so I can communicate with my husband more effectively but it isn't something that seems to fit nicely into a box and so it has been confusing.,1
ptsd,"I've been through psychotherapy, but I'm not sure the therapist was adequately prepared to identify it, but I know for certain that I have PTSD.",1
ptsd,From the moment I wake up and until I go to sleep I don't feel safe.,1
ptsd,When I'm around other people I feel even even more anxious/fearful.,1
ptsd,"I know nothing bad is going to happen to me, but I still feel this way.",1
ptsd,"I don't really have any friends, and these intense chronic feelings makes it seem impossible to make a real connection with anyone.",1
ptsd,I have been considering finally confessing my secret because it feels like I am choking on it.,1

ptsd,i was sexually assaulted almost 6 months ago.,1
ptsd,once i was assaulted i ate nothing for three days straight.,1
ptsd,i couldn’t stop losing the weight.,1
ptsd,"Had i not been up, My dad had thought I had broken a cup or something and wasnt going to bother checking, I was known for having insomnia at this point in my life already, so she may very well have attacked any one of us that night.",1
ptsd,I feel like I've failed.,1
ptsd,I keep having this fear that I've made it all up.,1
ptsd,"I'm afraid that I just have a very sick, sick dramatic mind that is just making up terrible shit to try and destroy me or something?",1
ptsd,But then I get angry so quickly and I feel terrible because I snapped at someone who didn’t deserve it and I just don’t understand where it comes from.,1
ptsd,"Or I’ll suddenly start thinking about what happened to me and I’ll get really really depressed, again out of nowhere.",1
ptsd,One minute I’m functioning okay and the next I seem like someone else.,1
ptsd,I don’t know if this is a symptom of my PTSD or if there’s something else mentally wrong with me that’s being piled on top of the PTSD.,1
ptsd,I was just recently diagnosed so I guess I’m still trying to figure out what’s the PTSD and what’s just me losing my mind.,1
ptsd,"So im m15 im still in school ive been through abuse when i was a kid it scarred my head i live with my mum now but i usually roam in woods playing guitar, i got diagnosed when i was 14 shit sucks gives me flashbacks whenever i close my eyes, my mind scans every goddamn thing in the area every fucking thing!, i just dont know how to explain its so complicated my brain acts weird at times i just need to know wtf is happening with me!",1

ptsd,"I'm scared, and I've been on edge for the past few days.",1
ptsd,"I'm way too small of a person, it doesn't even make sense.",1
ptsd,"He towers over me, how does he expect people to believe him?",1
ptsd,"No wonder I get scolded for bad grades, called a lazy, worthless piece of fuck because I am too lazy or too stupid to care about exams and my future, but in reality, I deeply care too much as if I feel like the whole fucking world of 7 billion people, and millions or billions of other organisms are on my shoulders ... and all I can do is to shut down entirely.",1
ptsd,"I shut down by brain, my thoughts, my emotions, everything because I cannot take all the anxiety.",1
ptsd,Sometimes I feel as depressed as if I am a lonely guy in a post-apocalyptic setting where everyone is either dead or absent or gone.,1

ptsd,"I’m asking bc I don’t want the therapist to yell at me or call me a liar like the last few did, so I’m low key nervous and I don’t want to get in any more trouble with my school.",1
ptsd,"Its hard knowing that everyone around you doesn't have these issues, It's hard that it takes an extreme amount of work just to make a normal day in life go by smoothly(which it almost never does) At first I felt like I had a grasps on this whole PTSD thing because it made sense when I first got diagnosed but the longer it's been the harder this is to deal with.",1
ptsd,Do you know what it's like to constantly feel uncomfortable in your own skin but you can never turn it off?,1

ptsd,My whole body is in shock from that panic attack and I just feel like death.,1
ptsd,I honestly doubt I will get better,1
ptsd,"I am no longer ashamed of what happened to me, but I still don't feel like I'm healing.",1

ptsd,I've convinced myself I'm going to get fired.,1
ptsd,I know I need to go back to counseling.,1
ptsd,And it literally makes me feel 10k x crazier than I already feel as it is.,1
ptsd,"Backstory, I’ve been seeing this doctor for 3 years almost now and at first I let her know my commitment issues with mental health, and having people just leave me stranded or pass me to new doctors every week and it made me bail the first few times I’ve tried to get my brain right.",1

ptsd,"I get flashbacks of waking up whenever we were at parties together and I've seen him awake once or twice and even though the likelyhood is very low (given the background of what he did), I can't shake the feeling that he mightve done something to me.",1
ptsd,What he did to her is giving me feelings like what happened to her was actually me.,1
ptsd,I'm scared I'm going to slip the next time I get in the car or on my motorcycle and just plow into something at full speed just because it'd be so easy and it might end all the pain.,1

ptsd,"I went from being this pretty normal looking student, short cropped hair, I would wear normal casual clothing on weekends, I was healthy, all that, now, over three years later I look completely different, I'm stick thin, hair grown out past my shoulders, I only wear black and almost always clothes that cover as much of me as possible, heavy scarring covering the majority of my body, and messy facial hair growing in.",1
ptsd,"I feel like I've completely altered myself so nobody is tempted to hurt me again, like I'm blaming how I looked for what happened, so completely changing it seemed like the most sensible thing.",1

relationships,(No mention has ever been made by them how much our daughter is having to miss out on by having this medical issue let alone what their own son is being put through from their lack of respect.),1

relationships,But I just feel like my trust is broken over and over and over again.,1
relationships,And I don't know what to do.,1
relationships,I was venting how pissed off she made me to one of my friends.,1

relationships,"She has a history of being extremely over the top, and in our most recent argument she verbally abused me just for because I was upset that she broke my trust by telling my personal details to someone I didn't know.",1
relationships,"Because she can be incredibly toxic, I've considered just blocking her and essentially ""ghosting,"" but I also feel like that would be very rude and she'd at least deserve an explanation.",1
relationships,How do I break up with her without having her potentially flipping out at me?,1
relationships,It’s gotten to the point where I feel like Tom is completely controlling me in the effort to “protect” me.,1
relationships,He won’t let me go anywhere without him and when he is forced to leave me he calls me every half hour and panics and comes home if I don’t answer (I don’t purposefully not answer- occasionally I am napping or studying).,1

relationships,The fact that he would prioritizing getting high over comforting me really hurts my feelings.,1
relationships,I'm tired of feeling like a plant is more important then me.,1
relationships,"but all I can think of is that I learned no one can be trusted including myself, people are inconsistent and unstable, people don't know themselves, if love exists then it doesn't mean much, and even if you truly believe that someone else cares about you and wants you in their life to the point where you finally don't question it, they can cut you off and start treating you like you're worthless without a moment's notice.",1

relationships,"It has been very hard for both of us, but I at least have the kids.",1

relationships,"She approached me and started to say something but I interrupted saying, “If this is about my phone, I am under no obligation to share with you anything that is spoken between me and a therapist, and I do not care that this is during work, I have an emergency number to call at any time when I feel like I have to, and I felt like this was important as I don’t want to go back to the psych ward.” She stopped and just said “oh, ok sorry.” I understand that this may be a negative on my performance at work, and I may not be entirely right, but I have cut myself at work (not during work but after shift and right outside at my car) and the way I was feeling I needed emergency counseling.",1

relationships,I don't know really what to do at this point.,1
relationships,Sometimes I think I'm making this a bigger deal than it should be.,1
relationships,His refusal to admit to anything though has me worried this is part of ongoing deception/cheating.,1

relationships,I don't know what to do anymore.,1
relationships,She ends up saying no almost all of the time and I'm getting to where I don't even ask because I feel bad that she has to say no.,1

relationships,He's the only one that can get me to that point of anger where I start sweating and shaking.,1

relationships,"I'm just at this weird point with myself where I'm holding back this resentment and anger at him for not taking care of himself, even after I've explained to him how much it stresses me out and hurts me when he is not consistent with his self care and/or medication.",1
relationships,"Though things are as normal as they can be right now, I find myself getting angry when he asks me to promise to do specific things for him, like do my laundry (I'm a bit of a mess), because it just reminds me of how he wouldn't keep that promise yet he expects me to do things for him (even though they are rational requests I should take care of anyway).",1

domesticviolence,Now I'm being charged with 4th degree DV and need legal counsel to prove my innocence.,1
domesticviolence,I'm clinging onto the last bit of hope I have.,1
domesticviolence,Wtf is wrong with this society?,1
domesticviolence,I’m pissed.,1
domesticviolence,I’m angry.,1
domesticviolence,I recently got out of a 2+ year abusive relationship and am now going to court against him with domestic violence charges.,1
domesticviolence,I am terrified to see my abuser in court and I was wondering what I should expect.,1
domesticviolence,I'm scared that I'm making the wrong descion.,1
domesticviolence,I actually do have access to some money where I believe I could pay off at least some of what I owe but I honestly don’t even know where I can get a number for the debts that I owe.,1
domesticviolence,"1) I am worried I might actually be in legal trouble over this, 2) I am afraid of seeking help from someone who isn’t understanding of my situation and will just be totally horrified about what a mess it is and they will be mean to me.",1
domesticviolence,I am NOT looking for a handout I just need help being walked through the steps of what I need to do to resolve this.,1
domesticviolence,Then I started to notice how much of a temper he has.,1
domesticviolence,Yesterday I was going to spend Christmas eve with him and his family and I tried bringing up some major concerns about the way things were going and he flipped out and started screaming and throwing shit.,1
domesticviolence,Am I nuts?,1
domesticviolence,Why am I so surprised i've come out looking like i've just had 10 round with Tyson?,1
domesticviolence,He has anger issues and he seems like a good guy sometimes (even though i know he's a fucking monster) and i know he's had a bad childhood.,1
domesticviolence,It's even harder because if he does get arrested or something for it my best friend won't have anyone to support her/pay for her tuition or her meals even... her mom doesn't have the money to do that and i think that's why she still stays with them... just so she can support her daughter.,1
domesticviolence,I really want to do something about it but idk what i can do.,1
domesticviolence,"Although I love him a lot, I don't exactly want the reason that I move in because he's trying to save me.",1
domesticviolence,I’m having a difficult time coping with how my abusive husband is perceived by family and friends.,1
domesticviolence,I sit next to him absolutely blank and speechless.,1
domesticviolence,If you intervene he will stoop down to the lowest level cursing his sons out with the worst imaginable.,1
domesticviolence,Am I imagining this or blowing it out of proportion?,1
domesticviolence,"Turns out I get really numb as the only way to not get dragged into this emotional swamp, but is a hell for its own.",1
domesticviolence,"But I told him that I’m not over it and his response was kinda like “ I feel so guilty, it makes my life hard, I wish you could just forgive me.” So now I feel pressured to forgive him and it’s frustrating because he didn’t give a damn about my feelings when I was 9 and crying my eyes out because I just saw my dad push mom and hit her.",1
domesticviolence,And I can’t help but feel like that fueled my brothers heroin addiction that almost killed him and still could cause he recently relapsed.,1
domesticviolence,I’m just so angry and I don’t want to be.,1
domesticviolence,What the hell can i do?,1
domesticviolence,"I'd let her hate me if it meant getting her safe, but I have no idea what this could do to the kids.",1
domesticviolence,"He works his ass off everyday, gives her money to pay bills, and she constantly goes gambling with her friend.",1
domesticviolence,I'm scared to start the eviction process but I NEED to protect myself and my son.,1
domesticviolence,"Hell, im even scared to  ask this asshole to take the trash out.",1
domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
domesticviolence,I feel like an empty shell of a person with no strength to get out of this mess.,1
domesticviolence,"The worst situations were forcing me to make a statement I knew was untrue (in order to allow me to get ready for work); becoming sexually rough and chasing me into another room to force himself on me, and rages where I’ve felt threatened.",1
domesticviolence,So why do I still feel conflicted about leaving?,1
domesticviolence,I guess I need an extra push.,1
domesticviolence,With my ass still against the door I grab the overflowing laundry basket.,1
domesticviolence,Sit on the fucking thing.,1
domesticviolence,He keeps saying im crazy not respecting his space where i keep asking for things to be amicable over and over.,1
domesticviolence,he tells me its my fault that everytime hes done anything to me its because i started it.,1
domesticviolence,I honestly dont know if its true.,1
domesticviolence,Because i kept trying to tell him leave me alone.,1
domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
domesticviolence,It's coming up so quickly and I'm feeling a twinge of anxiety as it gets closer.,1
domesticviolence,I keep telling myself I did everything I possibly could and that I should do what feels right to me even if it means I may feel like I'm going backwards at times.,1
domesticviolence,I also have to make a decision on if I want a permanent restraining order or a non violent contact order.,1
domesticviolence,"Myself and my brothers are contemplating getting a restraining order of some kind, but given how my dad operates, I'm not sure that will actually protect us from any harm.",1
domesticviolence,He spent most of the night afterhysterically crying telling me he can't live with himself after this and how he would never put his hands on a woman but something in him just snapped but I don't know how to forgive him or let it go.,1
domesticviolence,I'm still so shocked by what happened I have managed to stop crying and calm down but I don't know how to move on from here.,1
domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
domesticviolence,"The police are no help as I'm usually tossed in the squad car and questioned like a fucking criminal because ""why would she lie?"".",1
domesticviolence,I can't keep the 2400 a month in child support up because I can't get a job (I usually make 3000 a month net) and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be homeless in a few days.,1
domesticviolence,All I want is to help my daughter and make sure she's safe and I've run out of ideas.,1
domesticviolence,"I continued fighting his hold and he kept saying my name in a gentle voice and telling me to calm down, saying that he loved me and didn't know why I was freaking out, and kept saying, ""you know you're not going to win.",1
domesticviolence,"As time went on I would here everyday how I was too skinny, I need to gain some weight.. it got to the point to where I would ask questions about why I wasn’t good enough and was depressed ... he would throw a speaker in a room along with me and put stuff in front of the door to where I couldn’t get out.",1
domesticviolence,I'm so tired of this.,1
domesticviolence,I hate that he saw that side of me.,1
domesticviolence,I don't want to look weak in front of him.,1
domesticviolence,I don't want to give up on him because he's never given up on me.,1
domesticviolence,How do I get help?,1
domesticviolence,"She tries to take her keys away from me and I refuse, which turns into a full-blown fight.",1
domesticviolence,"I have marks and bruises all over my arms and back, as well as deep scratches from her fingernails.",1
domesticviolence,"At one point, she had me on the floor, cornered on the steps, repeatedly slamming my head into the wall and shoving a loose key that fell off the keyring into my breast, still trying to get the rest of the car keys out of my hand.",1
domesticviolence,"I'm not saying I didn't retaliate, but I only went to far as to push her away, never hitting her intentionally but more as an act of defense.",1
domesticviolence,I asked him where he had been because i was starting to get worried.,1
domesticviolence,Next thing i knew he was behind me with his arm around my neck squeezing.,1
domesticviolence,He continued as he threw me on the couch and wrapped his legs around my stomach.,1
domesticviolence,"I was upset his friend brought him somewhere that he ran into a girl he loves, and even though it was just a second it really hurt me.",1
domesticviolence,He isn't fulfilling the courts orders that would get him a chance to petition for supervised visitation.,1
domesticviolence,It feels like he's completely just disappeared from being a father but I still feel like he's going to come back.,1
domesticviolence,"He ended up grabbing me by the neck with both hands and slamming my head against the wall in the hallway, he threw me the ground I hit the radiator and then he threw a bucket at me that had a toy and DOG SHIT in it (i genuinely don't think he knew there was dog shit in it, he just threw whatever was there...and our dog must have shit in it.)",1
domesticviolence,I got right up and ran up the stairs and told him to let me in to get my shit so I can go.,1
domesticviolence,He told me to leave and I started kicking the door and demanding he lets me into get my shit so I can go.,1
domesticviolence,He immediately started screaming at my friends to “get the fuck out” and aggressively pushing them out of the back door.,1
domesticviolence,He then grabbed me by my arm and shoved me out the door yelling “take her fucking ass with you.” My friends sat with me for a minute and asked if I wanted to leave with them.,1
domesticviolence,Nobody should ever have to put up with that and have to live in fear of someone who can fly off the handle like that.,1
domesticviolence,I'm just not sure what to do or how to approach this.,1
domesticviolence,I’ve received hundreds of harassing contacts from him and he’s even tried to extort my friendship back by threatening to expose sex tapes.,1
domesticviolence,I’ve had him flip friends on me and had to move twice in the past to years to hide my location from him.,1
domesticviolence,"I’m trying to tell myself it’s like being beat up on the street by a stranger - it’s only once, but it still happened and it’s traumatic.",1
domesticviolence,It was someone I loved and trusted and I can’t believe he could have done this.,1
domesticviolence,"When I pushed him back, telling him to quit, he kicked me down to the ground and heel kicked my back until I had a panic attack and collapsed unable to breathe...",1
domesticviolence,Why am I feeling like I miss him.. I’ve been okay for 7 damn days & then he texted my grandmother & asked me if I wanted him to mail me my stuff (a card) & now I’m starting to feel bad.,1
domesticviolence,Why is he seeming so decent now... Why do I feel so damn guilty.. why do I feel like I did something wrong.,1
domesticviolence,But I’ve been ignoring him.,1
domesticviolence,Why do I feel like I’m in the wrong.,1
domesticviolence,When I told my mom I was in such a bad mental space that I thought I was going to kill myself and didn’t feel safe to be alone she said I couldn’t come over.,1
domesticviolence,I feel scared and I don't know if this would escalate into something worse.,1
domesticviolence,This is a really shitty time to need support or therapy because it’s a holiday weekend.,1
domesticviolence,"I’m in horrible physical pain, emotionally heartbroken and being ignored by my kids until I turn them back over to him tomorrow.",1
domesticviolence,I don’t even know why I am posting.,1
domesticviolence,I don’t know what to expect.,1
domesticviolence,I just want to not be so alone.,1
domesticviolence,"I can't be in an abusive relationship, but I find my brain trying to rationalize this.",1
domesticviolence,"he could not understand why i resented him, when in his mind, it was ME who was being 'abusive'.",1
domesticviolence,"because i couldnt fake being into sex with him, which made me a 'bad girlfriend', because i wasn't ecstatic about always having to take on every responsibility and basically take care of him as if he were a child.",1
domesticviolence,WELL FUCK YOU.,1
domesticviolence,When does this feeling of guilt go away?,1
domesticviolence,"He has made me eat until I literally threw up, then forced me to eat my vomit.",1
domesticviolence,He will point guns at me.,1
domesticviolence,"Also, I didn't want to make things worse for her by sticking up for her in public.",1
domesticviolence,This household is screwing with all of us.,1
domesticviolence,"I want to move out, but I have nowhere to go, no job, and no money.",1
domesticviolence,I don’t know how to make him leave because he says if I do that he will go and dispute all the charges I ever made on his debit card and say it was fraud and he will have me prosecuted.,1
domesticviolence,"He says he will do whatever he can to ruin my life and see that I lose my job and lose the respect of everyone in my life and have legal consequences go using his money (which again, he said I could but now he’s saying I’m lying).",1
domesticviolence,I feel like he literally dictates my life.,1
domesticviolence,I close the door and put my back against it.,1
domesticviolence,"He's slamming into the door, trying to break into it, yelling that I'm crazy and I'm making everything up.",1
domesticviolence,"I'm terrified and sobbing, yelling for help and for him to leave me alone.",1
domesticviolence,At this point I'm begging him to let me get my phone to call my dad to come get me.,1
domesticviolence,"He finally tells me that I can, and that he can't wait for me to be gone.",1
domesticviolence,"Is it that the nerves have cleared, minute by minute anxiety calmed, hopelessness resolved, and now I have to sit a grieve a person I made up in my head?",1
domesticviolence,I am broken but I am piecing myself together.,1
domesticviolence,Part of me wants to wait shit out until my green card gets here and then leave him.,1
domesticviolence,"No this isn't just some edgy teen, oh I hate my dad, I have every reason to hate him, for what he has done, and continues to purposely do to me and my family.",1
domesticviolence,"For nearly killing me, for scarring us all to the point I can't even meet a nice person, or have any friends, and not wonder whether they do or don't treat their family like a lump of sh**.",1
domesticviolence,Nobody should have to call the police because they don't feel safe within their own home.,1
domesticviolence,"I could stay up here alone, but he says he’ll be where ever we are.",1
domesticviolence,I feel trapped and I think it’s making me like I’m acting like a child these days.,1
domesticviolence,He drained my accounts and I’m financially dependent because I fear not paying bills and I have to feed my daughter and myself.,1
domesticviolence,I love the type of father he is but I hate the way he treats me.,1
domesticviolence,I have no one to open up to or go to if I even tried to leave him.,1
domesticviolence,I’m tired of him abusing me mentally and physically me.,1
domesticviolence,He has cheated on me several times and each time it knocks my self esteem Lower and lower.,1
domesticviolence,I received the silent treatment from him and him being drunk and telling me that i'm worthless and don't do anything for him.,1
domesticviolence,He backed me into a corner in the kitchen and kept hitting me.,1
domesticviolence,"When he starting choking me, I bit the holy hell out of his arm to get him off.",1
domesticviolence,"I was so confuse and in tears I didn't know what to do, but cry.",1
domesticviolence,How do we deal with this?,1
domesticviolence,I guess that also comes with ignoring me all night.,1
domesticviolence,"Not being able to let go of the fact that I let this go on for so long, and even the fact that in my heart I still care and want him.",1
domesticviolence,"I know he will never be real, open or honest about who he is or what he did.",1
domesticviolence,"I have to forgive myself for letting this take over my life, my heart, my emotions.",1
domesticviolence,"The worst/best part of this story is that I am still with this prick, trying to get away safely.",1
domesticviolence,"No Idea why I am here, guess I just need to vent.",1
domesticviolence,"I hate how I am and I wish I could die right now, but I don't have the drive to do it myself anymore.",1
domesticviolence,How do I leave him if I know that life without him has been and will be a worse circle of hell?,1
domesticviolence,"I really don't know what to do, I moved down south to be with her and so I have no friends or family here.",1
domesticviolence,"Its also her place so Im scarred she is going to kick me out, she has used that against me in the past, it makes me feel very vunrable and scared.",1
domesticviolence,My family victim blames and they’re are ok with a multi millionaire pedophile in the family.,1
domesticviolence,So they’re disgusting and no help.,1
domesticviolence,"I’m moving soon if I can get a damn plan together to his parents, they understand he’s crazy, but he really messes with my head.",1
domesticviolence,I didnt know what to say or what I could do to help.,1
domesticviolence,"Sorry for the sad story, I just don't know what to do and it's painful to think what is happening to her right now.",1
domesticviolence,"I hope it bothers you oh so much, to know you hurt me all by touch.",1
domesticviolence,"Everything about you is so mean, I just wish you could get clean.",1
domesticviolence,He was going to choke the name out of me.,1
domesticviolence,I am his 24/7 caregiver i do not have time to cheat even if i wanted.,1
domesticviolence,He said i would die if i didnt tell him.,1
domesticviolence,"So i get on top of him and i say, don't you ever do that again.",1
domesticviolence,"Everytime, he gets mad he takes my phone or other items away from me and tells me he bought it so it's his.",1
domesticviolence,"I don't know what to do, but I'm tired of feeling trapped and helpless.",1
domesticviolence,"I’m terrified of him, and praying that he gets the real help he needs at the same time.",1
domesticviolence,And I just don’t know how to sort that out.,1
domesticviolence,"I don’t know how to stop worrying and wondering what he’s doing, we have several court dates coming up so I think that adds to it.",1
domesticviolence,I’m just so exhausted and ready for this fight to be over.,1
domesticviolence,My friends and family don't understand why he is so jealous and controlling because they know when I'm in a relationship I'm faithful.,1
domesticviolence,"Im ready to take him out of my life, but what should I do?",1
domesticviolence,When hes angry I don't know what extent he would go to.,1
domesticviolence,How should I handle it?,1
domesticviolence,Ignore him or communicate calmly so he doesn't get mad?,1
domesticviolence,All of this has made me feel really horrible.,1
survivorsofabuse,I was going through a hard time after our breakup (started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist).,1
survivorsofabuse,He'd utterly lose control of himself.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Screaming so furiously I couldn't really understand him, grabbing me by the arms/shoulders and shaking me hard enough to give me whiplash, and continue screaming over me once I collapsed in a cowering heap when he let go.",1
survivorsofabuse,No one knows I have these fears.,1
survivorsofabuse,He shows me he loves me in many different ways but this is so hurtful when I'm aware that it's ridiculous to have these expectations.,1
survivorsofabuse,I guess I'm afraid I'll never stop feeling this way and I'll end up hurt him.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm sure it's because I have no practice at making friends and the history of relationships I have had feel laced with feelings of betrayal - so maybe I'm self-sabotaging a little bit.,1
survivorsofabuse,I finally feel like I'm a decent person.,1
survivorsofabuse,She wrapped her arms around me and cried for dear life I growled at him to stop at once for he had scared her..he tried to take her from me as he continued to yell and she would not let him touch her That was the final straw.,1
survivorsofabuse,I made a decision that I had enough of this fear and I was going to die fighting and not be afraid anymore.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I broke up there and then, realised I couldn't let go... we got back together, we broke up, he became abusive... it went downhill from there.",1
survivorsofabuse,I just couldn't let go of him.,1
survivorsofabuse,I guess I just want to know when or if I should tell him I hooked up with his friends?,1
survivorsofabuse,Even now she barely talks to me because I'm the 'outcast' for standing against what my family has done.,1
survivorsofabuse,"When I’ve broken up with someone, or had them break up with me, even if I’m heartbroken I’ve always been done.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Being quite bullied (nothing physical, mostly social stuff, shaming and that kind of jive), I really didn't have alot of people to talk to.",1
survivorsofabuse,I was scared.,1
survivorsofabuse,I felt fear at that point but took my back up bag and gave myself permission to leave if needed.,1
survivorsofabuse,"So often I feel like posting something personal, even a ""me too"" sort of comment on social media, relating to the abuse I went through when I was married (divorced 2 years now and moved far away), but every time I hold back because we have many friends in common, and I feel like speaking about my experiences would come across as badmouthing him in a public way and airing dirty laundry.",1
survivorsofabuse,I wish I felt like I could be more open about it.,1
survivorsofabuse,"But it all still feels like when I had to be so secretive about so many things, because he was so controlling.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I’m certainly not proud of making myself vulnerable in this way, but why am I even considering how I might have contributed to my own sexual abuse?",1
survivorsofabuse,"I told him that he could date this girl when we broke up, and I couldn't control that but I don't like them living together so soon after we break up.",1
survivorsofabuse,The next day I called M and told him what happened.,1
survivorsofabuse,He was furious and talked about breaking up and told me I lied to him and he had trust issues because of his ex girlfriend who attacked him with a knife or hatchet or something.,1
survivorsofabuse,The next thing I knew I wasn't going out anymore because he'd always get mad for some reason.,1
survivorsofabuse,He had stormed off shouting 'you're fucking useless'.,1
survivorsofabuse,It's scary and I know it will be hard.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Part of me wants to run from it because again, I do ok considering.",1
survivorsofabuse,I already feel like so much more of a person and in some ways that's enough.,1
survivorsofabuse,"From what she said after, she is worried I do not trust him, and is worried that I therefore do not trust her.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I don't know, she's forgiving and all, but it's like, everyone has a limit and I would understand if she did break up with me.",1
survivorsofabuse,I just wish I could tell her right now.,1
survivorsofabuse,I just want to get the anxiety over with.,1
survivorsofabuse,Then they joked around about how I reacted and that they were my biological dads magazines and i should get mad at him for it.,1
survivorsofabuse,"( No older than 14) My stepdad told my mom (this is what she says) that I wanted a massage, i was sleeping on the couch and my mom for whatever reason got freaked out and ran out of the room naked to see what was going on.",1
survivorsofabuse,And she says that he saw her and stopped walking towards me (13) my mom did ask me if anything happened on the way to school,1
survivorsofabuse,I feel like we cannot...do that.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I eventually came to accept what I went through by realising that I did nothing to deserve it, he's just a bastard.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I should be happy for them as it means he might have finally sorted himself out but I can't help but think that he's the same person he was, and I actually did deserve it.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I know it's not rational for me to think that, but I can't help it.",1
survivorsofabuse,Have I made it up somehow?,1
survivorsofabuse,Am I overreacting about this all?,1
survivorsofabuse,It's really got me in a tizzy.,1
survivorsofabuse,I feel relieved.,1
survivorsofabuse,I had no idea what any of this meant.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ve been sleeping so much I can’t tell how long I’ve been asleep.,1
survivorsofabuse,I was going through a difficult time after we broke up (started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist).,1
survivorsofabuse,It shows me that it loves me in many different ways but it's so painful when I'm aware that it's ridiculous to have these expectations.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm sure it's because I don't have any practice to make friends and the history of relationships that I've had with feelings of betrayal - so maybe I'm sabotaging myself a little bit.,1
survivorsofabuse,I finally feel like a decent person.,1
survivorsofabuse,"As sad as all this is, honestly if she hadn't told me that I would never have known.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I broke up there and then I realized that I couldn't let go... we got back together, we broke up, he became abusive... he went down there.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I wasn't sure we could ever be together again, but I no longer have feelings of sadness or resentment about what he did to me.",1
survivorsofabuse,I guess I just want to know when or if I should tell him that I slept with his friends?,1
survivorsofabuse,"I had horrible things that were happening to me before her, but it was really the absolute rock bottom.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I'm certainly not proud to make myself vulnerable in this way, but why am I even considering how I could have contributed to my own sexual abuse?",1
survivorsofabuse,"I told him that he could go out with that girl when we broke up, and I couldn't control that but I don't like them living together so early after we broke up.",1
survivorsofabuse,He was furious and talked about breaking up and told me that I lied to him and he had problems of trust because of his ex-girlfriend who attacked him with a knife or an axe or something like that.,1
survivorsofabuse,Lately I have been feeling very angry.,1
survivorsofabuse,Angry that my abusive ex received no real consequences for his actions.,1
survivorsofabuse,But she says she can't stand hearing it because she's got enough on her plate as she actually suffers with depression herself.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Maybe I'm just over exaggerating thing, but i feel like I need to get it off my chest.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Through everything, I just froze and waited for it all to be over.",1
survivorsofabuse,"This sends me into an extreme anxiety spiral, because I'd been seeing his mother almost every weekend for nearly five years, and she does this at the drop of a hat.",1
survivorsofabuse,I don't believe it.,1
survivorsofabuse,I finally decided to say something a month ago because it was really beginning to bother me because I'd hoped she'd slowly overcome these fears with time but she seems to be content with how things were and not going to change.,1
survivorsofabuse,"For the perpetrators, for the abuse, for the dysfunction, for my depression, my suicidal ideation, my pathetic life.",1
survivorsofabuse,However I was still in the prison of depression and plagued by self-destructive tendencies.,1
survivorsofabuse,And I'm just really confused and don't know how to feel or what to believe or think.,1
survivorsofabuse,Did he kill himself because of me?,1
survivorsofabuse,"Is it my fault he is dead now, and that my little brother has no father anymore?",1
survivorsofabuse,I'm just so confused and overcome with emotions right now.,1
survivorsofabuse,I am so scared that he will realize how fucked up and terrible I am and not want to continue things.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I don't want him to go and he keeps assuring me he will not, but I am so, so scared that sometimes it is overwhelming.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I feel like this is a disgrace on my part, because, logically, I know that he very much likes me and he really wants to stick around.",1
survivorsofabuse,I am so fucked.,1
survivorsofabuse,I want to just apologize and make things right but some of the things the other person probably forgot or were just super insignificant.,1
survivorsofabuse,I want to own up to my actions but it's hard.,1
survivorsofabuse,I assume if people find out I was a jerk they'll all hate me and I'll be an outcast and a pariah :/,1
survivorsofabuse,"I was raped by an acquaintance less than 6 months ago, and everything is hitting me all at once.",1
survivorsofabuse,This makes very uncomfortable and I don’t like it at all.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ll laugh and tell her to stop and that I don’t like the feeling of it.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Being in there was hell, I cried most of the first few days.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I was very disoriented, couldn't sleep, the windows had metal grates over them.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Then I get this weird gut feeling and ask ""have you been drinking?""",1
survivorsofabuse,I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age.,1
survivorsofabuse,Should I seek counseling?,1
survivorsofabuse,But I’m afraid if I do I’m going to have to talk more about what happened and I’m going to break.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and can’t remember anything.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’m sorry if I’m rambling on it’s just a hard subject for me to talk about and I don’t know how to put into words the emotions I feel towards these events.,1
survivorsofabuse,I don't have anywhere else to turn to.,1
survivorsofabuse,I recently contacted my abuser.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I don't know why, I think it's part of my self destructive behavior.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I have a history of child sexual abuse, rape in a past relationship and problems with dissociation.",1
survivorsofabuse,"So I was feeling like a robot that day again, due to stress.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I told him I am dealing with that again, he knows about my problems.",1
survivorsofabuse,I had suicidal thoughts while working at the island.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I remember vividly when I told him that everything was my fault (in my child mind obviously meaning ""you make everything my fault"" which was very much the state of things in the house growing up) and he straight up told me to stop fucking up so much if I didn't want things to be my fault (I should emphasize all ""fuck ups"" were minor- letting a pack of strawberries go to waste, forgetting to call him as soon as I left school, etc- but punished severely).",1
survivorsofabuse,"Hell, even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I can't gauge conflict to save the life of me- even if I'm being an absolute ass, I'll feel like I'm the one who's being persecuted.",1
survivorsofabuse,"They try to hold my hands when we go out, and when I told my dad I needed her to stop being so touchy with me, he guilt tripped the fuck out of me.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I’m 19 in a few days, I need to get out of here, but I feel so fucking guilty.",1
survivorsofabuse,Idk Do I tell someone?,1
survivorsofabuse,Do I just quit?,1
survivorsofabuse,I got a very bad feeling but I at first ignored it.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I was scared because I didn't know this man and I didn't understand why her Mother thought it was alright for a man to babysit 2 girls, one of them being a child he never had contact with.",1
survivorsofabuse,It's so hard to just get through a week without thinking of him and now I can't stop picturing his stupid face.,1
survivorsofabuse,I want to crawl into a hole and just cry and scream.,1
survivorsofabuse,It sucks even more because I won't be able to see my therapist this week because of the 4th of July holiday.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm so shaken up over this.,1
survivorsofabuse,Even though we did break up I don't know if he's taking it seriously and if he just thinks I'll come home and we'll be ok.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm so tired of being treated like shit by everyone in my life.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I'm not strong enough to take care of myself, to fight back, to leave.",1
survivorsofabuse,"And I can't work, I can't even answer phone calls because of my anxiety, how am I supposed to survive?",1
survivorsofabuse,"My family doesn't understand my mental issues so I can't get help from them with it, they tell me I need to start looking for a job and I can't even say anything.",1
survivorsofabuse,Why did I have to scream in pain?,1
survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes the bashings would be so bad that I would call my mum while she was at work [sometimes my brother and I would be home alone after I returned from school, when he would torment and bash me].",1
survivorsofabuse,Mainly because I'm not financially able to leave and live on my own.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I do plan on leaving, but until I make enough money to do so I'm stuck here.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I want to share what has led to this point, because to be honest I feel like I'm pathetic, weak in incapable of accomplishing anything.",1
survivorsofabuse,Everything I do to move forwards seems to be halted and I feel like I'm being pushed back.,1
survivorsofabuse,"So, long story short my parents are terribly abusive, I'm almost 30 and it took me this long, with the help of my wife to realize this.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes I feel like I can forgive him for what happened, but sometimes I have nightmares and I feel dirty.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I went from hating and fearing my father (since the incident with my sister, which had ended up triggering the memory of being told that I was to blame for the marital issues, among other things) to the point I couldn't even be around him at family or friend gatherings without feeling anxious and wanting to flee, to being able to accept the things that happened in the past, and remind myself that they are in the past, and be able to interact with him again, even if I don't really feel any familial love for him anymore.",1
survivorsofabuse,"He claims he was trying to help comfort me, but I really am having trouble believing that.",1
survivorsofabuse,"But it hit close to home when my own parents have pressured me over the years to reconcile with my brother, angrily demanding how I'd handle their funerals, whether I'd insist on not going (I wouldn't.",1

survivorsofabuse,"I still liked it, but I was so stressed from the move and from the constant crying and fighting that my libido was down.",1
survivorsofabuse,It sucks because I work on a computer and type all day at work and do needlepoint and sewing as a hobby and I can't do those things when it's this bad.,1
survivorsofabuse,I feel so angry that I am still covering up for my abuser.,1
survivorsofabuse,I am angry I can't e joy my life without him showing up randomly.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I'm violently sobbing, so yes, of course I want to stop.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I feel really bad about myself when it happens, sometimes I cry and other times I just have rage.",1
survivorsofabuse,I don't feel like I can talk about it with anyone.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I could really use some advice on how to deal with these memories and emotions when they take over, or if any of you have found ways to stop memories from popping up?",1
survivorsofabuse,"In the first month I was living here, I was doing a lot of really self-destructive things and ended up hospitalising myself, but now I have a job and am working very heavy hours to keep myself busy, and am not drinking heavily or using drugs or self-harming.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Unfortunately, I'm also more or less repressing all my feelings, and I'm having trouble with mood swings (particularly anger), anxiety and more recently, daily migraines.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Remembering all these things has caused me some distress, even though I doubt if this event qualifies as abuse...",1
survivorsofabuse,"I told them nothing of the sexual abuse, only the physical and emotional, as well as his constant threats to ""break your arm in that goddamn door if you don't sit fucking still"" I was removed from my home in two days and placed in a foster home until my biological father could drive up and take me to what was supposed to be my real home.",1
survivorsofabuse,"What I feel right now, is mirroring how I felt then but honestly it might be worse.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I am alone, and I don't know what to do.",1
survivorsofabuse,"At this time I'm most interested in any 'quick tips' that can be offered on how to manage feelings of violation, betrayal, humiliation, distress, anger at the abuser and all those who stood by, ignoring the damage she was inflicting, anger at those who have protected her at the expense of her victims, anger at my family for their mistreatment, and how they effectively set me up for future abuse.",1
survivorsofabuse,"My mom noticed and she started screaming at him, and they start having a heated argument.",1
survivorsofabuse,It bothers me to see people defending pedophila and I often feel the need to respond.,1
survivorsofabuse,I think it seemed a safe way to vent anger at surrogates for my abusers and I think I wanted a chance to say what I never had the chance to say as an abused kid.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I have PTSD from being raped and abused, and I get uncomfortable when guys yell in the vicinity of me, when they yell at me, it’s debilitating.",1
survivorsofabuse,I don’t remember a lot of it I just remember little snip bits of what happened.,1
survivorsofabuse,I still have problems trying to remember what happened and I feel like if I remember it all I’m going to have a breakdown.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age.,1
survivorsofabuse,It would seem getting this out there would be a huge turn off for her (it certainly is for me) so why is she acting that way?,1
survivorsofabuse,"Again, I don't tell her this but it's almost as if she's trying to account for infidelity, except she wasn't...she was abused.",1
survivorsofabuse,I'm just trying to solve this in my head.,1
survivorsofabuse,My emotions are a wreck.,1
survivorsofabuse,"It does not help that my mom leans on me and only me emotionally, when it comes to my father who I don't have a relationship with and all their financial issues etc...I am dealing with a lot personally, and then on the outside there family stuff on top of me too, and I feel trapped honestly.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I did go to a counselor about 12 times after the abusive relationship ended, I still felt vulnerable and scared leaving it that place and told her I don't feel ready to stop this.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Now I am at the point where I feel like there is nothing nobody can do for me, I feel emotionally trapped and I don't know what to do, or where to go anymore.",1
survivorsofabuse,I spent all of that time trying to get to this point by myself just so some selfish POS could slap me down again.,1
survivorsofabuse,I hate this.,1
survivorsofabuse,I asked him to stop but he just yells at me.,1
survivorsofabuse,I wish he would die or never talk to me.,1
survivorsofabuse,He also forces me to take medication because I got mad at him because of this.,1
survivorsofabuse,He will just scream at me and threaten to call the police to throw me on the street or something.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm so scared I actually don't want to lose him.,1
survivorsofabuse,tl;dr: I've gotten gaslighted in my past relationships and it's caused me to have a lot of self doubt about my thoughts and feelings and question myself constantly.,1
survivorsofabuse,in this case I'm questioning if im actually losing feelings since I'm developing crushes on others.,1
survivorsofabuse,Basically I’m going through quite a bit right now.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I suffer from anxiety, depression probably (low mood, irritation, poor concentration) and things just haven’t been going that well.",1
survivorsofabuse,I need to start setting some healthy boundaries and cut these people out of my life.,1
survivorsofabuse,Do I tell my father or just fade slowly into the abyss and never look back?,1
survivorsofabuse,"I think about it very often, wondering if I should just do it, get it over with, but something keeps holding me back.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I wonder if this was my fault, that I would be turned away for not bringing it to their attention earlier, if I would be accused of participating, I keep wondering if they’ll believe an 18 year old or a 40 year old.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I wish every day that I had quit that job sooner, that the second people warned me that I had had the nerve just to tell another manager how he was acting, that I had told anyone how uncomfortable and scared I was.",1
survivorsofabuse,I had no energy and I cried and I thought about suicide all day.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm afraid things will never change for me.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm not strong enough to change things for myself and I have no help.,1
survivorsofabuse,What can I do?,1
survivorsofabuse,But i think the worst part is her emotional abuse.,1
survivorsofabuse,Like having fun to make me scared or cry and also always putting me down like i am not good enough or ignoring me.,1
survivorsofabuse,Also i feel like she is sexually attracted to me (i am 17 now) and uses some shitty pretending to touch me between my legs or butt.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I once tried to talk with my dad about it, but he said that he and mom have enough to do and i should pull myself together.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I feel like i really have to seek help, but i am so scared that people wont take me serious and think i am exaggerating.",1
survivorsofabuse,I feel like you aren't putting in the effort with me and I feel sick and uncomfortable doing this.',1
survivorsofabuse,"I said this in a variety of forms as well as having panic attacks - not anxiety attacks, full-on violent shivering, mute shut-down, crying, overstimulated, feeling like you're about to die panic attacks - most of the times when we were intimate.",1
survivorsofabuse,"To me is heartbreaking to know that the most I can achieve is to keep defending myself, but not getting to be loved, accepted and cared.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Telling me I wasn't pretty enough, my boobs weren't large enough, I wasn't thin enough, I wasn't a good girlfriend to him, I wasn't making him happy.",1
survivorsofabuse,I felt so unsure of myself.,1
survivorsofabuse,He knows I can't work because of my anxiety problems and he knows I rely on him.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm scared to go back because I don't want to get back together with him and I know if he wants to we will.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’m very frustrated by this and don’t know what to trust.,1
survivorsofabuse,And I just don’t know which.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm looking for some encouragement to get through a phase where I currently just want everything to be over.,1
survivorsofabuse,Im so tired of thinking about things over and over.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Was it sexual abuse or wasn't it, should I move out or shouldn't I.",1
survivorsofabuse,All while I have less and less brain space to devote to schoolwork.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I've been suffering a lot recently, and I am on medication and undergoing therapy, but these bouts are cyclic, I always end up back in this position after a while, perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now, but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years), I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest, the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting, I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.",1
survivorsofabuse,"To other people it’s nothing, however to me, I can’t stand the thought of her being assaulted or harassed in that way.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Except all I want to do is protect her, part of me knows that she’s going to be okay, but I need some advice about how I should address the issue if this guy doesn’t stop, keep in mind the fact that I can wrestle and basically fight, and can someone tell me something that will help me hold onto the hope?",1
survivorsofabuse,I have suffered for years through an abusive relationship with my husband.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Drunk driving, attempting to detain me in one place so he could continue to yell at me, child endangerment, stalking, physical and sexual abuse, cheated on me multiple times, (including one instance I am sure was actually rape).",1
survivorsofabuse,I kicked him out months ago and filed for divorce as soon as I was able after that.,1
survivorsofabuse,"It's all the little things they do to invalidate my feelings, treating more like a live-in servant than a family member, and the occasional outbursts if they get angry/upset that trigger me badly...",1
survivorsofabuse,"It's making me lose ground, lose progress, and I'm having more and more trouble coping with everyday life...  And I'm afraid I'm going to just, break.",1
survivorsofabuse,"And I know this sounds so horrible and I hate myself for it, but I almost feel like it will never happen.",1
survivorsofabuse,And I feel awful for feeling that way but I've been trying (and patiently waiting) for nearly a year now.,1
survivorsofabuse,I just don't know.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ve started having nightmares again.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD (finally) and am working very little to try to get through this all.,1

survivorsofabuse,I’ve been in therapy since 19 but hadn’t disclosed to ANYONE about the sexual abuse by my two brothers.,1

survivorsofabuse,I cried and begged him to stop.,1
survivorsofabuse,"The therapist says it is self punishment, that I want these people to tell me what a piece of shit I am to verify what I already believe.",1
survivorsofabuse,"The verbal, emotions, and physical abuse continued I also believe in my heart that he cheated He left Facebook up on his computer with a conversation he had had with another ex about how much fun it was spending time with her(a day he had told me he was working late, couldn't even come up with an original lie)...it shattered me more, I didn't know my heart could break into any smaller pieces When she was three months old I told myself enough was enough...",1
survivorsofabuse,He was yelling at me about how it was an accident he just forgot and all I do is bitch.,1
survivorsofabuse,When we got to the store we didn't even go in because he said I ruined his mood or whatever and we just went home.,1
survivorsofabuse,I cried all day.,1

survivorsofabuse,I feel like I cannot trust anyone.,1
survivorsofabuse,"After the suicide attempt, which over nine years, head been preceded by the traumatic end of a highly dysfunctional five year relationship, followed by a severe four year alcohol problem.",1
survivorsofabuse,Leaving my dad.,1
survivorsofabuse,So since my mom left you are probably thinking that the abuse stopped there huh?,1
survivorsofabuse,I found out that my behaviors are probably caused by suppressing my memories and not finding proper closure from the incident because it’s as if I’m still taking the blame for an abuse that was done to me.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Knowing how terrible of a person he is that some people have even told me he is a narcissist or sociopath, I don't know why I still think I should have just stayed, why I should have just seen if he could change despite how he never tried to change throughout our years together.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I just want to stop myself from thinking this way and fully move on and have myself realize I am so much better off, and I even try to remind myself of all the bad things he has done but it seems that lingering thought of, ""Well, was it ever that bad?""",1
survivorsofabuse,"Three months of this and talking with the one friend whom I could call for free between 9pm and 6AM due to AT&T's GoPhone policies whenever I could get away with it, or texting on a Nokia Tracphone (the ancient indestructible brick phone), and my sister lashing out at me about being ungrateful that they allowed me to come over and use the internet, triggered by my snapping back due to, something, I can't remember, and I just, stopped asking.",1
survivorsofabuse,"The same negativity, the same feelings of selfhatred, of self-disgust, of ***believing*** everything my father had dumped on me slowly took over.",1
survivorsofabuse,"We had some verbal exchange in the hallway and he slapped me so hard I couldn't feel the tear roll down my cheek my face was so numb, he pinned me to the floor one day and savagely beat me for at least 7 minutes straight for what reason i forget, after he was done beating me up he would punch in the back of the head repeatedly, this gave me headaches and i saw flashes with each blow.",1
survivorsofabuse,"For the longest I didn't know this was abuse, nor did I know I had developed all of these poor coping mechanisms to deal with being abused.",1
survivorsofabuse,I wonder about that night.,1
survivorsofabuse,But I don't know if I would feel this way about my options if I wasn't anxious and wounded.,1
survivorsofabuse,I wonder sometimes how I am going to feel when I hit middle age.,1
survivorsofabuse,Am I going to feel like I do now?,1

survivorsofabuse,I would normally talk to my boyfriend but he's not awake and I don't even know what I'd say to him - I don't even feel like I can say anything out loud even if I was with him.,1
survivorsofabuse,So I let myself get sucked in and...,1
survivorsofabuse,The incident that occured was that I threw a fit - my arms and legs thrashing in all directions.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I had no idea what was happening, I came out of it terrified and there was one guy left in the room.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I remember thinking, he felt ""off"".",1
survivorsofabuse,"Since then I have heard from him once, in the form of a drunken voicemail pleading with me to forgive him and swearing that he doesn't remember anything.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I'm trying really hard not to victim blame and immediately feel guilt when I think that way but, again, knowing my wife how I know her - as someone that's not afraid to call BS- it just makes it hard to conceive how she went along with it for so long, knowing that it made her uncomfortable, knowing that it was escalating, and then it was actual happening and her not saying no.",1
survivorsofabuse,I just can't believe these things happened on repeated occasions.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I can absolutely see him pressuring her once, her not knowing how to respond when it happened, and then her saying ""This is BS, I'm out"" afterwards.",1
survivorsofabuse,"It wasn't an issue, nobody needed to know, now I don't even know *what* people apparently ""know"" and are arguing about.",1
survivorsofabuse,Somewhere under all the anger about my mum making an issue out of nothing there's something that makes me wonder if it *is* a big deal.,1

survivorsofabuse,"2 weeks ago I couldn't take it anymore and took a large overdose, which ended up with me being in hospital...I now have done a little damage to my heart and shall have to live with that...I should probably point out that I am under 7st and have had an eating disorder since I was 7...it was the only thing I could control...you see I had no safe place, I'd leave my abusive home and go to school...where I was the only ginger child...sure I don't need to point out how hard that was.",1
survivorsofabuse,"This is going to stop quite abruptly now, for I don't really know what else to say right now..
