ptsd,Probably kinda both.,0
ptsd,"Anyway, how are you all doing?",0

ptsd,"i never really knew people gave a shit about me, and it really meant a lot to me; it still does.",1
ptsd,"but if so many people are here for me, and things are going to be okay, why am i still afraid of them?",1
ptsd,why do i still have a pit in my stomach and why are these thoughts still clawing at the sides of my skull?,1
ptsd,why am i crying right now?,1
ptsd,"i don't understand it, i don't understand my own brain and i feel like an ungrateful prick for still being shaken up so badly.",1
ptsd,"My problem is, if I'm going to date anyone, they have to be aware that I struggle with PTSD and willing to at least be there for me when I need.",0
ptsd,"I don't need coddling or protecting, I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out, or help me through a flashback.",1
ptsd,"I need someone who can *be* present and emotional, and someone I can feel comfortable having a conversation with about it.",0
ptsd,"Everytime I have had a breakdown, and try to express things from the past, he audibly growls and talks about how pissed he is that it happened.",1
ptsd,He talks about what he'd do to my abusers if he ever found them.,0
ptsd,"I assumed she would answer the question, or she would explore my feelings of inadequacy, or she would interpret the transference.",0
ptsd,"But her response instead was the title ""I am not getting into this with you"".",0
ptsd,"She then went on with how she did like me, thought I was an interesting and nice person.",0
ptsd,"but I do not believe that, it is too unlikely.",0
ptsd,"Besides, as an addendum to her refusal to speak to my question, it seemed false.",0
ptsd,I wound up in partial hospitalization and diagnosed with PTSD related to several traumas including sexual assault I experienced as a child.,1
ptsd,I asked for a meeting with all of upper management so that I can start back up at work with clear boundaries for what I won't accept anymore.,0
ptsd,"This will be a good thing in the end, but right now I feel like I'm going to throw up.",1
ptsd,Meeting is in 3 hours.,0
ptsd,Send good vibes please?,0
ptsd,I recently went through an event that was extremely traumatic.,1
ptsd,"Without specifying what, it was recently everywhere on the news.",0
ptsd,It's been less than a week and not even sure what I'm dealing with here but all I know is that I feel like I am being discouraged from getting help.,1
ptsd,"Most of my recommendations have been people that are ""off-record"".",0
ptsd,I've talked a little with them and have talked amongst my friends and they say they do not feel they are any help.,0
ptsd,"It’s becoming cyclical for me, where I “retreat” and revise and then feel like I need to retrigger myself to avoid slipping back into denial that it happened the way it happened.",1
ptsd,I can’t live like this.,1
ptsd,I don’t want to live a lie but sometimes the lie is what keeps me functioning.,0
ptsd,My therapist is away for a month and this means I have no one to push me to deal with this thing.,1
ptsd,I don’t know what to do.,1
ptsd,It’s really kind of ruining my ability to empathize with some people Bc of comments they’ve made in the past.,1
ptsd,I witnessed the attempted suicide of my sister and then subsequent self harm targeting just towards myself for the purpose of manipulation and dealt with no one believing that it happened.,1
ptsd,"So many people have told me be happy it was a failed attempt, failing to recognize the damage knowing someone I love could want to hurt me so badly did.",1
ptsd,Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that.,1
ptsd,Trauma shouldn’t be a competition.,0
ptsd,And then I just want it to go away.,1
ptsd,"I dont know what to do about this, I feel like the world doesn't want me to talk about it.",1
ptsd,It's to uncomfortable for people...,1
ptsd,But I hate these feelings and they are just the tip of the iceburg that is ptsd.,1
ptsd,I felt like I needed to say something somwhere though.,1
ptsd,We decided to move states together and start a new life.,0
ptsd,We don’t live together (mutual decision).,0
ptsd,He wanted to marry me etc..and I started to see a change in his behavior ever since the move.,0
ptsd,He got flustered really easily or would get angry over something simple—traffic or a common life situation.,1
ptsd,"He seems to have no patience anymore, especially with me and will just shut down.",1
ptsd,It would take until my mid-twenties before I stopped letting people hurt me.,1
ptsd,But the trauma remains.,0
ptsd,"I've become a successful professional, happily married, with a home and pets (no children, I'll never have children after what I survived).",0
ptsd,I've been out of therapy for almost 10 years but my coping mechanisms have been failing.,1
ptsd,I'm having breakdown after breakdown after the slightest trigger and there are SO MANY triggers!,1
ptsd,"I saw a professional for a psych evaluation and though there are no flashbacks or nightmares, I still am placed with the ptsd label.",1
ptsd,"I know this isn’t something you just “get over” I just thought I moved on from my “trauma” I watched a few episodes of bojack horseman and it’s thrown me into an episode of depression Idk I’m sad, I’m mad, I get irritable I have no idea what symptoms and triggers are for me, I just keep going because if I don’t I’ll stop and fall apart.",1
ptsd,I’m like a piece of glass being held together by masking tape.,0
ptsd,I would’ve rather been told I’m a sociopath/psychopath or a narcissist due to my severe apathy towards everything.,1
ptsd,Thank you for reading and for your time.,0
ptsd,Update: I should probably add that I was terrified of my mom and never tried to provoke her.,0
ptsd,"I never snuck out, never got in trouble at school, no drugs, no drinking, no bad friends, tried to keep my grades up as best as I had time for, and never ever back talked; even though I dreamt of serving it to her one day.",0
ptsd,"My siblings would cry whenever they didn’t get what they wanted, they were rather spoiled, and would tell on me if I didn’t do what they wanted.",1
ptsd,Mom would be in the middle of homework or class and she’d just wail on me for no reason.,1
ptsd,That’s it for me.,0
ptsd,"Bye, world.",0
ptsd,I run and hide inside a key repairs store.,0
ptsd,The shop attendant give me a worried look.,0
ptsd,"I cannot move, even though I am fully aware I am standing in the door.",1
ptsd,Do I force myself to move forward?,1
ptsd,Am I being ridiculous because I still have ptsd?,1
ptsd,I feel like they’re so out of line.,1
ptsd,I’m all over the place.,1
ptsd,Just someone please help.,0
ptsd,As a result I had a total burn out.,1
ptsd,Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again.,0
ptsd,My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people.,1
ptsd,It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all.,1
ptsd,Her response was that a lot of people have f’d up things they have to deal with but they still have to do stuff.,0
ptsd,Cigarettes used to help but they don't anymore.,0
ptsd,"Alcohol helps, but then it comes back worse the next day.",0
ptsd,"In the months that it's not happening, I'm well-adjusted.",0
ptsd,I thrive.,0
ptsd,"But then my luck changes, someone starts listening to music next door or revving an old engine in their yard, and all my progress collapses.",0
ptsd,It's not really safe for me to be driving.,1
ptsd,I can't even function enough to do the grocery shopping.,1
ptsd,"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often.",1
ptsd,My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).,1
ptsd,Is this something a service dog would be helpful for?,0
ptsd,I am afraid of anything and everything at the same time I am afraid of what happened or what may happen.,1
ptsd,"I am afraid the world, the earth, the skies, the stars, aliens, humans, animals, whatever fucking bullshit thought that had occurred in my head that makes my skin crawl.",1
ptsd,I am afraid of what I am or what I might become.,1
ptsd,"I am afraid that I might go crazy or fight that I might become boring, or normal, or average, or weird, or some fucking hippie, or some fucking stupid hard-headed person.",1
ptsd,"So, I survived years of physical and sexual abuse as a kid.",0
ptsd,I'm finally at the place in my counselling where my therapist and I both think I'm ready to work through it.,1
ptsd,"I really like her and trust her, but the guided questions she asks remind me of how few specific details I actually remember.",0
ptsd,"Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger, and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore, and my body felt all weird and flat, my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule, my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it.",1
ptsd,It's like that scene in Inside Out where the characters become abstract shapes for awhile?,0
ptsd,Things got better in middle school (thankfully) but it’s sad how literally 5 years as a young child (when life was supposed to be good) were so rough and still affect my life to this day.,1
ptsd,My home life wasn’t super bad but school was a living hell.,1
ptsd,I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting.,1
ptsd,"Sorry for the rant, it’s just sad how cruel teachers and students can be in elementary school.",0
ptsd,Bullying in elementary school directly caused so many of my mental health issues.,1
ptsd,"And I’ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can’t breathe I’m shaking I’m numb.",1
ptsd,"And he is there just reminding me, gently... this isn’t happening right now.",0
ptsd,"This is your past, this isn’t our present.",0
ptsd,I’ve never lied to you.,0
ptsd,I’ve always kept my promises to you.,0
ptsd,I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive.,1
ptsd,My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day.,1
ptsd,My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents.,1
ptsd,I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it.,1
ptsd,In 2011 I finally met my husband who is the only reason I'm even doing as successful as I am today.,0
ptsd,"Unfortunately, it also affects pretty much everything in my life, including working memory and everyday events.",0
ptsd,"It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either.",1
ptsd,The neuropsychologist I saw offered me books to read to learn more about my condition but did not give any other treatment options because the cause of my disorder was unknown.,0
ptsd,"I was wondering if maybe now that I know why I most likely struggle with memory, I can go back to get more solid treatment options?",0
ptsd,"If so, who should I see for help?",0
ptsd,"However, this was 5 months ago and I have heard nothing about the referral.",0
ptsd,"Things are going downhill (not with my eating, which is good!",0
ptsd,"), but my PTSD symptoms are loud.",1
ptsd,"I'm not sleeping, my self harm has escalated and I'm struggling to leave my house.",1
ptsd,I'm also just about to lose my job because the company I work for is going under.,1
ptsd,"yesterday, I almost had sex with someone.",0
ptsd,"but when it was happening, I felt only halfway there.",1
ptsd,"and now my memory of it is hazy, and when I try to think about it I don't see it from my perspective, I see it from like above me.",1
ptsd,like it wasn't *actually*happening to me.,1
ptsd,"I genuinely enjoy having sex, but I would like to know ways to lessen my trauma symptoms and stay present during it.",0
ptsd,Now my treatment has stopped this triggering from happening and sometimes think about moving back.,0
ptsd,If I do I will occasionally see places and buildings connected to bad memories.,0
ptsd,When visiting my town now I am OK seeing those places but I don't like it so I avoid them.,0
ptsd,My choices are moving back or sell and start a new life elsewhere.,0
ptsd,So I ask if anyone else have done a similar move back to your hometown and managed well?,0
ptsd,The past few nights I have been drifting off to sleep and then I get the sensation that I'm falling and jerk awake.,1
ptsd,This happens for hours.,0
ptsd,"I forget the scientific name for this, but it doesn't really matter.",0
ptsd,"I've had it happen before to me, but never like 50 times in a row that prevents me from sleeping.",1
ptsd,Like fucking why?,1
ptsd,"But I do not even think the therapist is supposed to actually care, she actually seems to, but I cannot understand it.",1
ptsd,"I did not start therapy because I thought she would care, I started therapy because I jumped off a bridge 1 year ago and I have an 18 and 21 year old brother and sister who are too young to process a suicide, it would be wrong, so therapy is the thing I figured.",1
ptsd,"Now I feel like it is all that I live for, a part of me really likes how kindly she is.",0
ptsd,"But another part of me feels tied down these days, I am getting tired of this town and want to pick up my pack and go on down that open road just as I have 16 times in these past 15 years and she is the only reason I don't.",1
ptsd,"It feels great, but I'm worried.",1
ptsd,I tried to kill myself one year and one month ago.,1
ptsd,I am prone to depression.,1
ptsd,"I am worried about crashing too hard, and I have kids to care for.",1
ptsd,Has anyone else experienced anything like this?,0
ptsd,I started to get depressed but was personally unaware.,1
ptsd,"My wife started to notice that I wasn't eating, was moody, not sleeping, and laying in bed all day.",1
ptsd,She asked me if I was ok and I... broke down.,1
ptsd,All emotions came to a tipping point and I started whaling in tears.,1
ptsd,I told her I had been thinking about suicide.,1
ptsd,I wondered if anyone else had a similar place that they always found themselves in.,0
ptsd,I can't decide if it's healthy or not since most of the traumatic things that happened at home were in that space.,1
ptsd,"I'll find myself camped out, sobbing on the floor, but can't really pinpoint why it's the place I always seek out.",1
ptsd,"Secondly; if it's not helping me recover, how can I make the rest of my house more appealing?",1
ptsd,I'm not consciously choosing to end up in the kitchen it's just where I go.,0
ptsd,It sucks.,1
ptsd,I know I need help.,1
ptsd,I want to get help.,1
ptsd,"I was sexually abused throughout my childhood (at least 10 years, possibly longer).",1
ptsd,I forgot the memories for a long time but now I'm finally getting them back and it's freaking me out.,1
ptsd,My sleep patterns are erratic because I don't want to sleep anymore.,1
ptsd,Is it normal to have PTSD with nightmares EVERY time I sleep?,1
ptsd,Every time?,0
ptsd,My psychologist has started trying to slowly desensitize me by showing me pictures and videos of what disturbs me: this is currently making things worse.,1
ptsd,How long until I start to see improvements?,0
ptsd,And my nightmares are a terrifying mix of intense body horror and trauma flashbacks.,1
ptsd,So I wake up even more tired and in pain which makes me miserable during the day.,1
ptsd,"So now I'm having my chronic pain flaring up, my other PTSD symptoms kicking my ass, my other mental illnesses acting up, and on top of that I'm too tired from the nightmares to do anything about it.",1
ptsd,I just can't fucking win.,1
ptsd,I'm so so tired.,1
ptsd,"Hi everybody, I'm a 22 year old male who has had extreme depression and anxiety issues since I was 12 years old.",1
ptsd,I was also a competitive swimmer growing up and these issues started flaring up when I was moved into an age group with a very strict and demanding groups.,1
ptsd,"1.5 hour swimming sessions (4k yards) 6 days a week with a 30 minute dryland practice everyday or every other day, I believe.",0
ptsd,I had swam maybe one meet before getting placed into this group and was completely overwhelmed.,1
ptsd,And I’m scared all the time.,1
ptsd,"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories.",1
ptsd,And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating.,1
ptsd,I’m sorry.,1
ptsd,I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.,1
ptsd,"my abuser is in my family, and i am in the process of healing but every family reunion/holiday i must see my abuser causing me to enter panic attacks, constant crying, and flashbacks, causing an uproar to what could make me so ""troubled"" I am afraid of coming out to my family in case of being removed for my family forever and damaging relationships.",1
ptsd,I have younger family members i am trying to protect so i feel alot of weight on my shoulders when i am having a bad PTSD episode around my abuser and my younger family members.,1
ptsd,Also there was an attempted rape on me when I was 21.,1
ptsd,I never realised how much an effect these events had on me.,1
ptsd,There is another woman that I like (F32).,0
ptsd,She is very intelligent and we talk all the time.,0
ptsd,The problem is that I am married even though my marriage is awful.,0
ptsd,I grew up believing that everything bad that happened was my fault.,1
ptsd,"I have tried so hard to make something of my life after that hell, but now that everything feels like falling apart again I feel like I am breaking.",1
ptsd,This must mean that I am truly worthless and a waste of life.,0
ptsd,"I feel like I'm not even allowed to feel like this, because I deserve this hard life.",1
ptsd,Has anyone experienced horrible burn out because of PTSD/OCD?,0
ptsd,"I don’t have anything to ask atm or anything that anyone else need to know, but i cant go to someone when I’m not coping or in a state, I feel like it’s something I have to ride out on my own, that I can’t tell anyone about.",1
ptsd,"I hate going throw this on my own, not that my family don’t try to support me, I just don’t want to see mum cry again because I’m broken and she’s tryed every thing she can but nothing helps.",1
ptsd,"Iv had more 5 therapist and seen at least that again in one off meeting, but I can’t engage and have developed a vague phobia towards them, I used to hide in the house when I knew I had an appointment and only come out if I was promised I didn’t have to go.",1
ptsd,"So It’s been largely untreated, not throw lack of trying.",0
ptsd,I can’t see my condition changing.,1
ptsd,I just never had proper doctors who could diagnose me.,0
ptsd,There's a very long story there.,0
ptsd,I suffer from PTSD because I have been abused my entire life.,1
ptsd,I was physically abused by my teacher when I was 8 years old.,1
ptsd,"My mother physically, mentally and emotionally abused me, up until I left her house at 16.",1
ptsd,I had a skin graft.,0
ptsd,"It hurts, every day.",1
ptsd,"Not all the time, but usually when I'm upset or having a hard time.",1
ptsd,It'd be nice to know the pain isn't all in my head and maybe it's actually a physical consequence.,1
ptsd,It just hurts.,1
ptsd,"I thought if I changed, if I did everything for him, he would love me like I wanted him to.",0
ptsd,I broke it off a few days ago.,0
ptsd,For good.,0
ptsd,I can't help but feel so guilty for doing so.,1
ptsd,"At least when I was 12, that man went to prison for 40 years.",0
ptsd,I think that's what it's called.,0
ptsd,Where you relive your trauma and talk about it to take the emotional response and power away.,0
ptsd,I am just nervous and very scared.,1
ptsd,Has anyone did this kind of treatment?,0
ptsd,Did it help?,0
ptsd,"But there is no certainty, and I am so scared I am going to fuck this up.",1
ptsd,"I want so bad to do the work, be better, and show kindness to those who have been so kind to me.",0
ptsd,But none of that seems meaningful in the dead of night when I cannot sleep and get so sad and ruminating.,1
ptsd,I just do not know what to do to improve it or fix it.,1
ptsd,"This is longer than I intended, thank you to anyone who reads this, any ideas or advice at all are appreciated.",0
ptsd,"I grab my partner and told him “ we need to get out of here right fucking now!” We made hour way out of the building, as we were exiting the conditions increasingly got worse, just as we made the door the room flashover, my partner was already in the hallway I was still in the room.",1
ptsd,"Many times when firefighters are caught in a flash over the outcome is death, for me it was burns to years, wrists, and face.",0
ptsd,I still consider myself very lucky.,0
ptsd,After that I started struggling with anxiety at work and home.,1
ptsd,On my days off I started to drink excessively.,1
ptsd,Hello r/ptsd.,0
ptsd,I'm currently almost 19 but suffered a lot of traumatic events within my immediate family between the ages of 10-15.,1
ptsd,"Earlier this year, I noticed that I had terrible body odor (I shower and wear deodorant everyday) whenever I left the house.",0
ptsd,"This was obviously accompanied by some unbearable anxiety, as well as very severe panic attacks.",1
ptsd,"After talking to my psychiatrist and a therapist, they diagnosed me.",0
ptsd,"I didn't tell anyone, not even my family.",1
ptsd,"I felt I had to protect them; They were already insolved with CPS (Trust me, though, they're awesome) and I knew if i brought abuse into our case, I would inevitably send them down an unnecessary path.",0
ptsd,"Social workers don't blame the abuser, they jump to the conclusion of negligent parents; Parents who were irresponsible enough to not know this was going on.",0
ptsd,"They didn't know, they didnt know because they couldn't know.",1
ptsd,"I went out for a few hours and they assumed I was hanging out with my friends, at least that's what I planned to do; They assumed I went to school and got an education, not beatings when the teacher was out of the room.",0
ptsd,I can't stop feeling miserable.,1
ptsd,"It's not even because my ex is going crazy, because he's once again proven I don't get to control my own life.",1
ptsd,I can't let go of the prosecutor telling me I only hear what I want.,1
ptsd,"I don't even know what he was referring to, but it has to be true because I honestly don't remember agreeing to dismiss he case.",1
ptsd,"I'm guess I'm not doing as well as I thought, and I must be as crazy as I now feel.",1
ptsd,"I gathered my composure, went back and sulked until I was asked if I could put something in my eye sight to block it out.",0
ptsd,"I got a little excited, found a huge box and was able to move on with my day.. until about 3 when the owner came over, moved it, and then asked me if I was keeping it for anything.",0
ptsd,"I mentioned I was blocking the signs, she asked why and I said, well, I feel they are kind of negative... And then she told me ""They aren't negative, they are funny, and since you don't think so you should think on if you even want to work here"", walks away and proceeds to tell my boss it isn't working out with me........ all because I expressed that I felt the signs were negative.",1
ptsd,Stupid me for thinking dozens and dozens of instant in your face surprise red circles could ever equate to negativity.,0
ptsd,I guess I have a new trigger.,0
ptsd,Advice on how to deal with friend?,0
ptsd,And advice about how to deal with the impact of this on myself?,0
ptsd,Self-esteem hit new lows and had already felt really humiliated about assault before and wanted to tell friends to stop feeling so bad about it and to be able to talk to someone on days when my PTSD got really bad.,1
ptsd,"But now I feel even more humiliated about it and feel like anyone that knows is going to see me as damaged, so theres a lot of shame.",1
ptsd,I'm also terrified to talk to anyone else about it.,1
ptsd,I was recently diagnosed with PTSD (theoretically CPTSD but that's not an official diagnosis so whatever).,0
ptsd,It's been 3 years since I escaped my abuser who abused me for 3 years as well.,0
ptsd,"However because I was so young (high school/college), people have disregarded the validity of my abuse- which results in me hiding it from the world.",1
ptsd,"That sucks, but it's not as bad as what it does to me.",1
ptsd,"On top of crippling anxiety about everyday life, I have a terrible fear of commitment that I didn't realize I had until I moved in with my current boyfriend.",1
ptsd,"Now while yes it could have taken me 30 minutes to figure out the bleach ratio, it was weird because once it was 2:30 I realized it was time to make the kids snack, and I went to look for the little baskets we put the food in and they were gone.",0
ptsd,"I was frantically looking for them and I asked my coworker if she saw them, she explained in a confusing manner that she already made snack.",0
ptsd,And if she made snack she would have been right in front of me because we were in a very small kitchen.,0
ptsd,"And if I were ""there"" I definetly would have known.",0
ptsd,"And when I came out of this ""blackout"" I was really groggy and anxious.",1
ptsd,I’m struggling to figure out what’s wrong with me at the moment.,1
ptsd,I’m wondering what caused you all to find out that you may have PTSD?,0
ptsd,Was it something you noticed yourself?,0
ptsd,Did family members point it out?,0
ptsd,Etc.,0
ptsd,Today I also had to write down all the emotions I could think of then put a color next to each word that I felt “matches” the emotion with markers.,0
ptsd,And the next page There’s an outline of a human body.,0
ptsd,I had to put each color(emotion) where I feel it on my body.,0
ptsd,"I’m slightly annoyed because before all of this she’s been taking me very seriously and helping with so much, and now I feel like she’s being demeaning?",1
ptsd,Should I just see where this takes me or let her know that this feels slow and pointless at my appointment next week ?,0
ptsd,It makes sense to see danger around every corner.,0
ptsd,But I wish I could find a place where it isn't so dark.,1
ptsd,I read a story the other day about someone who couldn't work anymore and just needed to be at home.,0
ptsd,.,0
ptsd,.,0
ptsd,Usually after each session I get a headache also.,0
ptsd,"I can't tell if i'm becoming worse, because I did EMDR on my bad drug experiences and feel great now.",1
ptsd,"The rest of what i'm dealing with is early childhood trauma, which was prolonged so i'm thinking EMDR is just bringing out these feelings and making my body become very unhappy since im reprogramming it to not constantly be hyper aware and anxious.",1
ptsd,Ive had a few hospital visits because after some sessions i turn into a hypochondriac because the physical responses are so odd.,1
ptsd,One session made the left side of my face numb.,1
ptsd,I need quiet and darkness to recover from a major trigger like that.,1
ptsd,I went inside and sat in the bathroom with the lights off.,0
ptsd,"We had left the radio on in the bedroom and it was blaring so loudly, but I couldn't move I just needed to sit for a little bit.",1
ptsd,I thought I had calmed myself back down so I went into our office.,0
ptsd,He came into the office all furious.,0
ptsd,I can't go anywhere without and inhaler and I tested positive for asthma even though I've never had an issue before all this happened.,1
ptsd,"I'm on busphar, celexa, and atomoxetine and I've been on them longer than the hallucinations and such.",0
ptsd,I don't know what to do.,1
ptsd,I feel like I should go to get psychiatric help but now that I'm in college and only working part time I'm scared of not being able to pay the doctor bills.,1
ptsd,I don't know what to do.,1
ptsd,I’m really tired.,1
ptsd,It seems like the moment that I’m starting to recover or I’m starting to get some sort of progress.,0
ptsd,I get triggered and I have to start all over again.,1
ptsd,It’s so hard to see the point in fighting all of this all the time.,1
ptsd,I still live with my abuser and sometimes I can make it.,1
ptsd,"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often.",1
ptsd,My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).,1
ptsd,Is this something a service dog would be helpful for?,0
ptsd,Or does it have to be a lot worse than that?,0
ptsd,"Sorry if it's a weird question, it's just something I've been thinking about.",0
ptsd,I'm not getting any resources from the VA and I'm not getting better.,1
ptsd,"I'm 100%, war time, service connect disabled for PTSD.",0
ptsd,"I've been kicked out of the MHICM Range program because ""I'm not making enough progress”—ie not magically getting better.",0
ptsd,Im currently doing ACT therapy but it's not helping and the VA here can't offer talk therapy so they referred me to the Vet Center.,0

How am I even supposed to ""heal"" when I'm probably making everything up, I'm probably not broken, I'm just going to get yelled at again at the new therapy place like my last one because I'll be mute every session (don't even know why, I tell myself ""because I'm not ready to talk about it"" but it's been over 5 years since the last case and all this crap is minor, so it's probably just being ashamed over doing all this crap for god-knows-why when barely anything happened to me...), because ""I'm not trying"".",1
ptsd,"I don't even know why I'm posting this, probably just begging for more attention, I've pushed the last true friend I had away a few days ago over my fears of therapy.",1
ptsd,"My memory goes, I panic, breakdown, rock back and forth, sit in closets.",1

ptsd,I didn't know that either but I still felt the same.,1
ptsd,And he was well aware of what I was going through as much as he could have.,0
ptsd,Also that whole living situation and that man was horrible and stressful anyway (without it being a trigger for something else too).,1

ptsd,I felt so gross and grimy having his nasty hands on me calling me beautiful.,1
ptsd,"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories.",1

ptsd,"Unfortunately, my meds only impact anxiety (and only sometimes), not depression or PTSD.",0

ptsd,now i get flashbacks in school.,1
ptsd,"I used to enjoy quantitative courses but now i get tension headaches from the flashbacks, and feelings of horror and hyperarousal.",1
ptsd,I just feel so violated and disturbed that it was for fear of his violence that i didn't close the door - and that he was watching me!,1
ptsd,"My vagina feels tension too, which i read from a PTSD book is a common symptom.",0
ptsd,They would text and call constantly throughout the day begging me to forgive them for hurting me but that  they're in love and love can't be stopped.,0
ptsd,They got increasingly angry and started calling me selfish for trying to keep them apart.,1
ptsd,After I wrote a bit about the sexual abuse in an anonymous online diary my ex (who knew my username but I thought I had blocked from the site) started harassing me more.,0
ptsd,Angrily telling me that I need to stop pretending he raped me and how I wanted everything that happened and that I was just a jealous ex.,1
ptsd,"I won't and kinda can't (remember missing pieces of time) go into all the details, but he gaslighted me pretty bad.",1
ptsd,Sometimes I'll stop and just stand somewhere or stare until I get snapped out of it.,1
ptsd,I don't know for how long but it can't be for more than 10 minutes.,1
ptsd,I just found out about catatonia and I show a few other symptoms.,0
ptsd,When I dissociate it's usually a lot more violent and delusional so I thought maybe it was something else.,1
ptsd,"I haven't brought it up with my therapist because I just had a meeting with her before learning about this, am I just looking too deep into things?",1
ptsd,I only get it when I have a flashback or strong reaction to a trigger.,1
ptsd,"I notice it sticks around even when I feel emotionally calm and can stick around for a long time after the trigger, like days or weeks.",0
ptsd,It’s a new symptom I think.,0
ptsd,Also been having lots of nightmares again recently.,1
ptsd,"Not sure what to do as I’m not currently in therapy, but I am waiting to be seen at a mental health clinic.",1
ptsd,I go through periods where all night I have nightmares and I can’t slee because of them.,1
ptsd,These periods last for weeks or months on end and then stop briefly.,0
ptsd,"Three years ago I used to be on a medicine that helped with the nightmares, I can’t remember the name though.",1
ptsd,It was a really old blood pressure medicine from the fifties that they gave to soldiers returning from war and they figured out that it helped with ptsd too.,0
ptsd,But it made me so tired.,1
ptsd,#NAME?,0
ptsd,My version of events wasn't believed due to ten other witnesses denying it and I was expelled immediately.,1
ptsd,I got home and unexpectedly my bags were already packed.,0

ptsd,"You're going to Portland two weeks early.""",0

ptsd,"I'm waiting to tell work about what happened, that I can't come in.",1
ptsd,I'm going to the hospital with her.,0
ptsd,I don't care if they're mad or if I get fired.,1
ptsd,I just feel so shaken and scared still.,1
ptsd,I feel like I've taken a giant step back.,1
ptsd,"I'll address this in my next counseling session, but does anyone know if this sort of reaction is common during a recovery process?",0
ptsd,TL/DR: Abusive relationship led to a violated protection order.,0
ptsd,"The subsequent criminal trial has made me question my emotional stability, and memories.",1
ptsd,"Are the symptoms of CPTSD causing me to fail in my interactions on a day to day basis, or has there simply been a bizarre miscommunication?",1
ptsd,I wish I could go back and just not fuck up so horribly.,1
ptsd,I was begged not to go out on this date from tinder.,1
ptsd,My friend was raped off tinder and told me all guys want are sex off tinder.,1
ptsd,I had talked to my assaulter and told him I didn't want to be touched and he was fine with it and seemed perfectly normal.,0
ptsd,I'm so stupid.,1
ptsd,"I'm new to Reddit and have only really discussed my issues with trauma and PTSD with my partner and therapist, and I am struggling with the random dissociative cycles of derealization and depersonalization.",1
ptsd,And I'm so tired of it.,1
ptsd,I've been in therapy for half of my life.,1
ptsd,"I write and also listen to music to help when I'm having issues, but it never feels like enough.",1
ptsd,So I started talking to myself (which I do under stress) and drinking and this was a piece of the conversation:,0
ptsd,I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.,1
ptsd,That was the scariest part.,0
ptsd,It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion.,1
ptsd,I know most of you will say ‘you need to leave’ or something obvious - yes I know.,0
ptsd,"But things aren’t that easy and than there’s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he, of all people, will change.",1
ptsd,I'm afraid of going into too much detail only because I constantly fear that he knows that I talk about him.,1
ptsd,"To keep it short, my father was physically violent towards me, my mother, our dog, mistreated all of his animals, leaked our information on shady sites before multiple times, and has made my life a living hell up until I went to court to stop having visitation with him.",1
ptsd,I almost died twice thanks to him.,0
ptsd,"I thought that it wouldn't really affect anything outside of startle reflex, trust issues, etc, but here I am years after my last visit with him and it's still affecting me fucking terribly.",1
ptsd,I just sat in bed sobbing for a half hour because I'm afraid of everyone around me.,1
ptsd,I'm assuming I have PTSD and my work gave me a number to call and I'm debating doing so.,1
ptsd,But I hate asking for help and I feel pathetic because nothing happened.,1
ptsd,I'm physically fine.,0
ptsd,I just really need advice because I'm struggling on how to feel.,1
ptsd,I don't know why I can't just brush this off considering I'm alright.,1
ptsd,"However, today I was sitting at work and for whatever reason I started thinking about the knife incident.",1
ptsd,"This new person I'm dating has never done anything wrong, but I had a thought of what they would look like holding a knife.",0
ptsd,"It was a pretty stupid thing to think about, it caused the worst panic attack I've had in months and had to go for a walk around the block to clear my head.",1
ptsd,I don't want the event from my previous relationship to have an impact on the potential of this new one.,0
ptsd,Does anyone have any advice for breaking free from this sort of thing?,0
ptsd,I don't want to feel like a burden to anyone anymore and to myself so the feeling of wanting to die didn't go away.,1
ptsd,I don't know how to deal with myself or with other people since I feel like I should just get over it and continue with my life but I can't and I'm 22.,1
ptsd,Am I exaggerating?,0
ptsd,Am I just so weak that I can't deal with what happened to me that I can't normally continue with my life?,1
ptsd,I was a good student and a good friend.,0
ptsd,I feel like I'm at the end of my rope here.,1
ptsd,I bawl every night because I don't want to feel this never ending pain anymore.,1
ptsd,I can't live with what happen to me.,1
ptsd,I can't live with the fact that since I didn't go to police that he is preying on another girl like me.,1
ptsd,I have so many social problems I dont have friends anymore.,1
ptsd,I’m so concerned as we head into warmer months.,1
ptsd,"I know I need to leave the area and that’s on my agenda, I just can’t do that before summer comes and goes.",1
ptsd,I am currently trying to come up with ways to manage my day to day life.,1
ptsd,"Working from home, not venturing outside as much as possible.",0
ptsd,But even the ride from home to office is enough to send me into a spin for about an hour.,1
ptsd,"Without my boyfriend who I thought was my best friend, my two female friends who used to always have my back becoming distant, and now not knowing who or what to trust seeing as Nex and I still work in the same industry my PTSD is just skyrocketing off the charts.",1
ptsd,"With no roots put back down yet (which I’m working on the living sit) and no one close to turn to emotionally, how the fuck do I go on?",1
ptsd,When is enough enough?,0
ptsd,When is it too much?,0
ptsd,I know giving up is not an option but it is all so overwhelming...,1
ptsd,"When it's abuse in the workplace, it seems like everyone just says, ""Oh, get over it, and don't be a baby.",0
ptsd,"There's nothing wrong with you.""",0
ptsd,I actually had one women tell me that my husband's behavior was 'completely normal' and that 'everyone acts like that' (I was floored.,0
ptsd,I don't know one other person who goes through shit like this at work or who acts like that - WTF?).,1
ptsd,"They just want to brush it off, and no one gives a shit.",1
ptsd,Does anyone else experience parts of their PTSD this way?,0
ptsd,&#x200B; Is this truly avoidance or is this dissociation?,0
ptsd,I tried to do some digging and pin down what I am experiencing so I can communicate with my husband more effectively but it isn't something that seems to fit nicely into a box and so it has been confusing.,1
ptsd,Thank you.,0
ptsd,"All of these things were a slow burn, many of these things overlapped one another.",0
ptsd,"I pushed through and finished my PhD, but now I'm worn, and after looking into it, I've realized that the psychological symptoms of stress I display are closely aligned with racism-specific PTSD.",0
ptsd,"I've been through psychotherapy, but I'm not sure the therapist was adequately prepared to identify it, but I know for certain that I have PTSD.",1
ptsd,I want to begin healing now that I'm done with grad school.,0
ptsd,Where/how do I start?,0
ptsd,From the moment I wake up and until I go to sleep I don't feel safe.,1
ptsd,When I'm around other people I feel even even more anxious/fearful.,1
ptsd,"I know nothing bad is going to happen to me, but I still feel this way.",1
ptsd,"I don't really have any friends, and these intense chronic feelings makes it seem impossible to make a real connection with anyone.",1
ptsd,That's what I need the most is some sort of real connection with another human being.,0
ptsd,Is it more than that?,0
ptsd,I have been considering finally confessing my secret because it feels like I am choking on it.,1
ptsd,"I repress it as much as I can, but when it bubbles to the surface, it effects everything in my life.",1
