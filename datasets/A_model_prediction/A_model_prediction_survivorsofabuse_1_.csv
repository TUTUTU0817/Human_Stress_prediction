survivorsofabuse,my dad was in the back of the room and another man i had never met wa sitting next to him.,0
survivorsofabuse,He asked me if i had ever had any gay encounters.,0

survivorsofabuse,I do read other people's posts and think maybe I've actually had it easy.,0
survivorsofabuse,"Maybe I'm just over exaggerating thing, but i feel like I need to get it off my chest.",1
survivorsofabuse,Anyway thanks for reading.,0
survivorsofabuse,( sorry the post is so long ).,0
survivorsofabuse,"Through everything, I just froze and waited for it all to be over.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Each time I petitioned her to stop, she would become very visible distressed.",0
survivorsofabuse,She spent a lot of time talking about suicide.,0

survivorsofabuse,I had to get our old counsellor - mine and N's - involved to speak to her.,0
survivorsofabuse,She said the mother is taking things seriously.,0
survivorsofabuse,I don't believe it.,1
survivorsofabuse,This has begun to bother me since I do try to please her and go out of my way to have a little foreplay but she never really returns that favor.,0
survivorsofabuse,It has become a one sided physical relationship.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I've even had multiple times where I have trouble getting it up, and its largely due to the fact that I receive no physical stimulation prior to intercourse.",0
survivorsofabuse,We've known each other a year and been officially dating for about 9 months.,0
survivorsofabuse,I finally decided to say something a month ago because it was really beginning to bother me because I'd hoped she'd slowly overcome these fears with time but she seems to be content with how things were and not going to change.,1
survivorsofabuse,I don’t know that.,0
survivorsofabuse,I think I’m responsible for all of it.,0
survivorsofabuse,"For the perpetrators, for the abuse, for the dysfunction, for my depression, my suicidal ideation, my pathetic life.",1

survivorsofabuse,However I was still in the prison of depression and plagued by self-destructive tendencies.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Although I had some more regular income I would often binge on the euphoria of having money (I was still a teenager after all), spend too much in my mania and then quickly sink into paranoia and avoidance when rent day came along.",0
survivorsofabuse,And I'm just really confused and don't know how to feel or what to believe or think.,1
survivorsofabuse,Did he kill himself because of me?,1
survivorsofabuse,Did he know I wanted to see him or did they simply never told him?,0
survivorsofabuse,"Is it my fault he is dead now, and that my little brother has no father anymore?",1
survivorsofabuse,I'm just so confused and overcome with emotions right now.,1
survivorsofabuse,I am so scared that he will realize how fucked up and terrible I am and not want to continue things.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I don't want him to go and he keeps assuring me he will not, but I am so, so scared that sometimes it is overwhelming.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I feel like this is a disgrace on my part, because, logically, I know that he very much likes me and he really wants to stick around.",1
survivorsofabuse,But there's a part of me that genuinely believes I am not good enough and that I will not be enough once he realizes that.,0
survivorsofabuse,I am so fucked.,1
survivorsofabuse,Is this common?,0
survivorsofabuse,How did you deal with it?,0
survivorsofabuse,I want to just apologize and make things right but some of the things the other person probably forgot or were just super insignificant.,1

survivorsofabuse,The bathrooms were locked and you had to ask for permission to use the toilets.,0
survivorsofabuse,While I was waiting to use the toilet the nurse came in my room and grabbed the door out of my hands forcefully and I didn't let go (I think its my right to use the bathroom when I need to).,0
survivorsofabuse,"She then came back with a bunch of men and they held me down to the bed, pulled down my pants and gave me a shot in the butt of some sedative.",0
survivorsofabuse,"I walk up to the door, unlock it and open it.",0
survivorsofabuse,It's K. With my boyfriend standing by in sight I ask him what he's doing here.,0

survivorsofabuse,In which he shakes his head.,0
survivorsofabuse,I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age.,1
survivorsofabuse,Should I seek counseling?,1
survivorsofabuse,But I’m afraid if I do I’m going to have to talk more about what happened and I’m going to break.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and can’t remember anything.,1
survivorsofabuse,I’m sorry if I’m rambling on it’s just a hard subject for me to talk about and I don’t know how to put into words the emotions I feel towards these events.,1
survivorsofabuse,"First off, I want to apologize for posting here so often.",0
survivorsofabuse,I don't have anywhere else to turn to.,1

survivorsofabuse,This is an idea that my father also reinforced in me heavily.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I remember vividly when I told him that everything was my fault (in my child mind obviously meaning ""you make everything my fault"" which was very much the state of things in the house growing up) and he straight up told me to stop fucking up so much if I didn't want things to be my fault (I should emphasize all ""fuck ups"" were minor- letting a pack of strawberries go to waste, forgetting to call him as soon as I left school, etc- but punished severely).",1
survivorsofabuse,"Hell, even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I can't gauge conflict to save the life of me- even if I'm being an absolute ass, I'll feel like I'm the one who's being persecuted.",1

survivorsofabuse,Idk Do I tell someone?,1

survivorsofabuse,I got a very bad feeling but I at first ignored it.,1
survivorsofabuse,The babysitter was a man and someone I had never met!,0

survivorsofabuse,Her Mom proceeds to leave the house and we're there with this strange and creepy man.,0
survivorsofabuse,I was completely uncomfortable the entire time.,0

survivorsofabuse,It's so hard to just get through a week without thinking of him and now I can't stop picturing his stupid face.,1
survivorsofabuse,I want to crawl into a hole and just cry and scream.,1
survivorsofabuse,It sucks even more because I won't be able to see my therapist this week because of the 4th of July holiday.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'm so shaken up over this.,1
survivorsofabuse,Even though we did break up I don't know if he's taking it seriously and if he just thinks I'll come home and we'll be ok.,1

survivorsofabuse,Why did I have to scream in pain?,1
survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes the bashings would be so bad that I would call my mum while she was at work [sometimes my brother and I would be home alone after I returned from school, when he would torment and bash me].",1
survivorsofabuse,I would run into my room and lean against the bedroom door with all my weight while my brother kicked and punched through it from the other side.,0

survivorsofabuse,Still no-one stopped him.,0
survivorsofabuse,"Me and my Dad aren't on speaking terms, however we do live in the same house.",0

survivorsofabuse,Everything I do to move forwards seems to be halted and I feel like I'm being pushed back.,1

survivorsofabuse,Before it happened I had been good friends with him and I admired him a lot as a child.,0

survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes I feel like I can forgive him for what happened, but sometimes I have nightmares and I feel dirty.",1
survivorsofabuse,I think of what happened a lot.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I've been seeing the same one since then, and she'd helped me process so much, help me recognize and start to move past a lot of things...",0
survivorsofabuse,"I went from hating and fearing my father (since the incident with my sister, which had ended up triggering the memory of being told that I was to blame for the marital issues, among other things) to the point I couldn't even be around him at family or friend gatherings without feeling anxious and wanting to flee, to being able to accept the things that happened in the past, and remind myself that they are in the past, and be able to interact with him again, even if I don't really feel any familial love for him anymore.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I care about him, his wellbeing, but...  That familial bond isn't there, he killed it the he came to retrieve his stuff, a couple days after walking out...",0
survivorsofabuse,The only time I ever stood up to him.,0
survivorsofabuse,"He made some snide remark about my mother, and I told him to go ahead and run from his problems like he always does, and he backed me into a corner and shook me, screamed over me when I collapsed, until my mother came home and made him leave.",0
survivorsofabuse,It seemed like there was no recognition of my emotional state and like he just wanted me to be quiet.,0
survivorsofabuse,That scares me.,0
survivorsofabuse,"He claims he was trying to help comfort me, but I really am having trouble believing that.",1
survivorsofabuse,This is the second time something like this has happened.,0
survivorsofabuse,The first time was when we were arguing and it was getting really heated.,0
survivorsofabuse,"But it hit close to home when my own parents have pressured me over the years to reconcile with my brother, angrily demanding how I'd handle their funerals, whether I'd insist on not going (I wouldn't.",1
survivorsofabuse,"My brother was best man for our other brother's wedding, which I attended but declined being a bridesmaid, and kept a careful distance.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Then I went home, drank an entire bottle of wine and cried while my husband comforted me).",1
survivorsofabuse,2.,0
survivorsofabuse,I never would have known about my cousin's son if I hadn't been able to make the funeral yesterday.,0
survivorsofabuse,He was furious I'd 'kept' that from him.,0
survivorsofabuse,I had considered doing cam modelling though had never gone through with it (again before we even met) .,0
survivorsofabuse,He accused me of lying and keeping things from him.,0
survivorsofabuse,"On top of that, he still expected sex all the time.",0
survivorsofabuse,"I still liked it, but I was so stressed from the move and from the constant crying and fighting that my libido was down.",1
survivorsofabuse,It sucks because I work on a computer and type all day at work and do needlepoint and sewing as a hobby and I can't do those things when it's this bad.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Of course when people (family, coworkers, friends) see the brace they ask what happened.",0
survivorsofabuse,I always blame carpal tunnel.,0
survivorsofabuse,I feel so angry that I am still covering up for my abuser.,1
survivorsofabuse,I am angry I can't e joy my life without him showing up randomly.,1
survivorsofabuse,When I went back the next day he said the good news was he wasn't going to lie to me anymore.,0
survivorsofabuse,"He said ""if you can take a raping like that and still come back, there's nothing I could do to make you leave.""",0
survivorsofabuse,"And ""There's no point in lying any more"" He always told me from then on when he was cheating, doing something wrong, etc.",0
survivorsofabuse,I thought about turning him in.,0
survivorsofabuse,I took some pictures on my phone to maybe show the police.,0
survivorsofabuse,"It was the same therapist I'd been seeing since I was little, when I was first diagnosed as ASD (at the time termed PDD-NOS, as I didn't *quite* fit the diagnostic requirements for Aspergers), and she, had honestly stopped being helpful.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started.",1
survivorsofabuse,"So, I eventually stopped going.",0
survivorsofabuse,"And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.",0
survivorsofabuse,He knew about this.,0
survivorsofabuse,He asks me if I want to stop.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I'm violently sobbing, so yes, of course I want to stop.",1
survivorsofabuse,He holds me for a couple of minutes.,0
survivorsofabuse,"And then he starts talking about T again, even though we'd broken up the sexual arrangement months ago.",0
survivorsofabuse,I have some tainted memories with my dad and have doubts about my grandpa.,0
survivorsofabuse,Anyway I don't control when some of these memories and questions pop up.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I feel really bad about myself when it happens, sometimes I cry and other times I just have rage.",1
survivorsofabuse,I don't feel like I can talk about it with anyone.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I could really use some advice on how to deal with these memories and emotions when they take over, or if any of you have found ways to stop memories from popping up?",1
survivorsofabuse,"In the first month I was living here, I was doing a lot of really self-destructive things and ended up hospitalising myself, but now I have a job and am working very heavy hours to keep myself busy, and am not drinking heavily or using drugs or self-harming.",1
survivorsofabuse,"Unfortunately, I'm also more or less repressing all my feelings, and I'm having trouble with mood swings (particularly anger), anxiety and more recently, daily migraines.",1
survivorsofabuse,Any suggestions?,0
survivorsofabuse,"Particularly suggestions for someone who works 40+ hours a week, so doesn't have much time to relax anyway?",0
survivorsofabuse,"I hate living here, but don't have much choice for the foreseeable future.",0
survivorsofabuse,"I didn't understand why he wanted to get me an erection, and I certainly didn't want him to do that to me, but he did.",0
survivorsofabuse,I think I was around 11 at the time It's been 10 years.,0
survivorsofabuse,My relationship with that cousin isn't a bad one as of now.,0
survivorsofabuse,"Remembering all these things has caused me some distress, even though I doubt if this event qualifies as abuse...",1
survivorsofabuse,Child protective services were called and I was interviewed.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I told them nothing of the sexual abuse, only the physical and emotional, as well as his constant threats to ""break your arm in that goddamn door if you don't sit fucking still"" I was removed from my home in two days and placed in a foster home until my biological father could drive up and take me to what was supposed to be my real home.",1
survivorsofabuse,On my mothers side of the family I have an aunty and my nene along with various cousins.,0
survivorsofabuse,"My father kept me separated from them for two years, finally relenting when I cried and begged to see them.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Is it also possible that since I was so young, my mind distorted and hid these memories to make them less painful?",0
survivorsofabuse,I don't know what brought them back.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I'm not in therapy nor have I been actively seeking any type of ""breakthrough"".",0
survivorsofabuse,"I was sexually assaulted when I was 14 by a close friend's boyfriend, and the memories didn't come back then.",0
survivorsofabuse,"What I feel right now, is mirroring how I felt then but honestly it might be worse.",1
survivorsofabuse,"I am alone, and I don't know what to do.",1
survivorsofabuse,"At this time I'm most interested in any 'quick tips' that can be offered on how to manage feelings of violation, betrayal, humiliation, distress, anger at the abuser and all those who stood by, ignoring the damage she was inflicting, anger at those who have protected her at the expense of her victims, anger at my family for their mistreatment, and how they effectively set me up for future abuse.",1
survivorsofabuse,Dissociative symptoms are a significant problem at this time.,0
survivorsofabuse,"Focusing on a movie, tv show, video game, book, even a short song can be impossible at times.",0
survivorsofabuse,"The interest in 'quick tips' on how to manage those overwhelming emotions is an attempt to make it feasible to read a fre books I'm hoping might help (Pete walker's CPTSD and James Chu's Rebuilding shattered lives, MacKenzie's Psychopath free).",0

survivorsofabuse,Some monsters are real.,0
survivorsofabuse,I was abused by some as a kid and I was recently reminded that they are still out there.,0
survivorsofabuse,I sometimes manage to find myself in reddit threads with discussions about pedophilia.,0
survivorsofabuse,It bothers me to see people defending pedophila and I often feel the need to respond.,1
survivorsofabuse,I think it seemed a safe way to vent anger at surrogates for my abusers and I think I wanted a chance to say what I never had the chance to say as an abused kid.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I met my current boyfriend (42M), let’s call him V, back in November.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Things were fine, there were no red flags.",0

survivorsofabuse,Now that I’m older I’m starting to have sex and be intimate with others.,0
survivorsofabuse,I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age.,1
survivorsofabuse,It would seem getting this out there would be a huge turn off for her (it certainly is for me) so why is she acting that way?,1
survivorsofabuse,"Again, I don't tell her this but it's almost as if she's trying to account for infidelity, except she wasn't...she was abused.",1

survivorsofabuse,My emotions are a wreck.,1
survivorsofabuse,I'll definetely reach out to a therapist soon but could use help in the meantime.,0

survivorsofabuse,"Now I am at the point where I feel like there is nothing nobody can do for me, I feel emotionally trapped and I don't know what to do, or where to go anymore.",1
survivorsofabuse,"It's important that people know this when they claim platitudes about 'getting support' and 'healing' that require a stable home, friends, family or even relationships.",0

survivorsofabuse,Now at 30 years old I went to a therapist.,0
survivorsofabuse,I found out that my behaviors are probably caused by suppressing my memories and not finding proper closure from the incident because it’s as if I’m still taking the blame for an abuse that was done to me.,1
survivorsofabuse,He purposely said the most hurtful things to me during our break up to make himself feel better.,0
survivorsofabuse,"And one of the worst things of all, like I mentioned earlier, he sexually assaulted and that also happened when he knew we were breaking up.",0

survivorsofabuse,"We had some verbal exchange in the hallway and he slapped me so hard I couldn't feel the tear roll down my cheek my face was so numb, he pinned me to the floor one day and savagely beat me for at least 7 minutes straight for what reason i forget, after he was done beating me up he would punch in the back of the head repeatedly, this gave me headaches and i saw flashes with each blow.",1

survivorsofabuse,The problem is I've recently moved to Japan on my own and have no one to talk to here.,0
survivorsofabuse,I would normally talk to my boyfriend but he's not awake and I don't even know what I'd say to him - I don't even feel like I can say anything out loud even if I was with him.,1
survivorsofabuse,So I let myself get sucked in and...,1
survivorsofabuse,The incident that occured was that I threw a fit - my arms and legs thrashing in all directions.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I had no idea what was happening, I came out of it terrified and there was one guy left in the room.",1
survivorsofabuse,This guy told me I was possessed by an evil spirit.,0

survivorsofabuse,I found that November and December were a struggle and because of that I planned to address my stuff by going to therapy starting in 2019.,0
survivorsofabuse,It is not like her - even when she was that age - to succumb to pressure like that.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I'm trying really hard not to victim blame and immediately feel guilt when I think that way but, again, knowing my wife how I know her - as someone that's not afraid to call BS- it just makes it hard to conceive how she went along with it for so long, knowing that it made her uncomfortable, knowing that it was escalating, and then it was actual happening and her not saying no.",1
survivorsofabuse,I just can't believe these things happened on repeated occasions.,1
survivorsofabuse,"I can absolutely see him pressuring her once, her not knowing how to respond when it happened, and then her saying ""This is BS, I'm out"" afterwards.",1
survivorsofabuse,But that she stuck around and let it happen multiple times just seems odd to me.,0
survivorsofabuse,"It wasn't an issue, nobody needed to know, now I don't even know *what* people apparently ""know"" and are arguing about.",1
survivorsofabuse,Somewhere under all the anger about my mum making an issue out of nothing there's something that makes me wonder if it *is* a big deal.,1
