ptsd,"For my spouse, it didn‚Äôt, and she started seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist.",0

ptsd,"During the pregnancy and after the (traumatic) birth of our first child in 2013, symptoms started to intensify, including lots of depression, some manic behavior, and periodic angry outbursts.",0
ptsd,Somewhere in there we settled on a very (relatively speaking) effective combination of mental health meds that stabilized symptoms.,0
ptsd,"We had our second child in 2015, after which an injury led to the discovery of a debilitating and incurable connective tissue disorder.",0

ptsd,Trauma survivors often don‚Äôt need more awareness.,0
ptsd,They need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them.,0
ptsd,"At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame.",0
ptsd,"Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being ‚Äúdefective‚Äù or ‚Äúnot good enough.‚Äù Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved.",1
ptsd,They live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right.,0
ptsd,Ok so firstly I should say she hasn't been formally diagnosed but it's at this point a logical conclusion that she's suffering some kind of ptsd from a rape that she endured a couple years back.,0
ptsd,It was before I knew her and when we met she seemed to be pretty stable.,0
ptsd,Although I know now that's not the case.,0

ptsd,What is for you the most relatable portrayal you have seen/heard I don't have PTSD but reading a retired Marines blog I noticed that when he was talking about his PTSD it sounded a lot like Rick in the Walking Dead.,0

ptsd,"It was not until this past summer that I thought to try therapy, something I had actively avoided.",0
ptsd,"I didn't think that talking about anything would affect my bipolar disorder, and I **really** didn't want to talk about my trauma.",1
ptsd,I waited a bit and then went and talked to our advisor.,0
ptsd,I vaguely and briefly explained what happened so I could get his help in understanding some procedures I didn't understand.,0
ptsd,We went down to the lab and figured out my work together.,0
ptsd,I was then standing and doing something with my samples while my advisor was doing something else in the room.,0
ptsd,Then I suddenly looked up toward the door and entirely expected my fellow student to burst in yelling about how I told our advisor.,0
ptsd,"People may quickly think ""drugs"" but just try and quickly think ""animals"" unless you are dangerous when you have your episodes or become angry after them.",0
ptsd,Just think that all of that drug money some people spend could go on raising and giving a loving home to an animal who will heal him/her.,0

ptsd,I've dealt with treatment resistant depression since I was a child.,1
ptsd,I began therapy at 10 and over the years tried more medications than I can possibly recall with no success.,0
ptsd,Last summer a Ketamine Treatment Centre came to my city and i became one of the first patients.,0
ptsd,It turned my life around.,0
ptsd,"For the first time, something worked.",0
ptsd,He told me that I needed to be naked because he wanted to see my ‚Äúsexy body‚Äù he said a lot of sexual things and took off my clothes.,0
ptsd,"I was naked; exposed, lying on his bed on my stomach with my head in a pillow.",0
ptsd,He flipped me over and sat at the foot of the bed.,0
ptsd,I put a pillow over my face and at this time it all becomes a blur.,1
ptsd,"He was giving me oral sex, fingering me, and telling me how ‚Äúhot‚Äù I was.",0
ptsd,I also have been taking Zoloft 25mg for 12 days.,0
ptsd,I plan to start exercising nightly for 20 minutes beginning tonight.,0
ptsd,"I want to do all that I can to alleviate my symptoms but if there is a cure, I would love to know.",0

ptsd,"I have PTSD, and have for about 15 years with varying degrees of symptom severity after a sexual assault.",1
ptsd,Right now my symptoms are pretty well controlled and I am in regular therapy.,0
ptsd,Largely I am only dealing with nightmares and a heightened startle response and doing really well overall.,1
ptsd,In the last year I started dating an amazing man.,0
ptsd,"One of the couples I know is made up of cancer survivors:  the male had cancer as a child, thankfully beat it, but developed PTSD from the experience; the female has had 2 different battles with cancer (brain and breast), beat them both, but suffers from significant developmental issues (including cognitive delay and balance issues).",0
ptsd,"They represent polar opposites on the spectrum of how cancer survivors can view the world:  one feeling positive about having survived so much, the other being angry with the world that it happened in the first place.",0
ptsd,That's neither here nor there.,0
ptsd,I'll stop for a moment to explain that I'm not one of those that feels PTSD isn't a real condition.,0
ptsd,"I grew up in an abusive home for years, and it wasn't until my mid 20's that I began come to terms with how subtly that had affected me over the years.",1
ptsd,"Last summer I (F17) was officially diagnosed with PTSD, though I had been suffering from the condition for at least a decade.",0
ptsd,It's been a lot to process but I'm finally getting the psychiatric attention and emotional support I need to slowly repair myself.,0
ptsd,"I remember after I had explained my traumas and symptoms to my current therapist, I asked her if I it was true that I had something wrong with me (my psychiatrist had told me the week prior that much of what I was experiencing aligned with the PTSD diagnosis and I was startled).",1
ptsd,"I'll never forget her saying ""No, you definitely have PTSD,"" and in that moment I experienced more validation of my suffering then I had in my entire life.",0
ptsd,"Shell shocked, I told my mom about it in the car and she made it very clear to me how there was no way in her mind that it could be that serious.",1
ptsd,any way.,0

ptsd,I always do.,0
ptsd,cheers if you read this.,0
ptsd,I'm just saying my frustrations out into the void.,1

ptsd,Occasionally I still feel anxiety when alone and bored at my house.,1
ptsd,My depression is now not a problem at all but the legacy it left is annoying.,1
