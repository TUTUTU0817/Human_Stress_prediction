anxiety,When I was 17 I was arrested when police raided a friends house because they were tipped off that there was to be some under-aged drinking.,0
anxiety,I won't go into too much detail but what stems off of that is thoughts of being and feeling worthless like I'm not good enough for anyone and that I'm undeserving of the good things given to me but then another thought stems off of that one which would be something along the lines of me thinking how stupid I was acting and then another thought after that and so on.,1

anxiety,I will try to make this easy to read!,0
anxiety,Context: I have been struggling with alcohol abuse and I am currently 4 months sober (yay!).,0
anxiety,The first month without alcohol my withdrawals were intense.,1
anxiety,"I became so angry, my anxiety was off the map and I couldn't concentrate on anything at hand.",1
anxiety,At the time I was taking 20mg of paroxetine and my GP doubled to 40mg for 6 months while my body was trying to face without alcohol.,0
anxiety,"And it is the fault of who, then?",0
anxiety,"My question to you; is it the fault of the tree that he never took the trouble of putting in the effort to correct himself, or the hypothetical forest?",0
anxiety,Is it someone of the fault of all?,0
anxiety,"Could the tree ever be fixed enough, or was it destined to live his life, becoming more and more twisted with every fucking day?",0
anxiety,I've been taking Sertraline (Zoloft) for about 10 years now.,0
anxiety,"At my lowest points, I was taking 200 mg a day but I've been stable on 150 mg a day for some time now.",0
anxiety,"I'd like to be completely absent one day, but I know it will take a lot of time and work.",0
anxiety,"My question is, can someone tell me their experiences with withdrawal symptoms?",0
anxiety,"I feel like I dropped my colleagues and I was afraid to be reprimanded, fortunately the owners were understanding.",0
anxiety,I never had an optimistic outlook on travel.,0
anxiety,I never traveled further than a province or two and it makes me so nervous and anxious to think about it.,1
anxiety,"My first instinct is to thank you for the offer, but my answer is no.",0
anxiety,One of the owners came to talk to me and explained how much a worker I am and how much appreciated I am around the office.,0
anxiety,"I never thought, I ruined everything, I ruined everything.",1
anxiety,Maybe a few more days will bring me back to normal.,0
anxiety,Certainly stop the alcohol.,0
anxiety,It's an obvious trigger.,0
anxiety,"But yes, I just wanted to ask his thread on your thoughts.",0
anxiety,"I know it will cause a vote to forget, but every time I see this sentence, it feels so negative.",1
anxiety,"Anxiety can be cured, you can feel normal again and you could even say that managing it is a cure anyway.",0
anxiety,"People without anxiety manage fear and anxiety on a daily basis is just that it comes to them naturally without even notice, that's the point we have to get back to to being cured.",0
anxiety,I guess I'm not the only one who feels demotivated when they see this phrase so maybe use less on here guys?,0
anxiety,I've been struggling my whole life with weight.,1
anxiety,"Since last month, I've been dieting like a madman, counting calories, working, etc.",0

anxiety,"But the ladder won't move, inches won't move, nothing.",0
anxiety,"So, I decided I'm going to talk to my doctor about reducing lexapro next week when I go to see it.",0
anxiety,"Hey guys, I just want to hear your opinions on this.",0
anxiety,So I only had ptsd for about 5 years now after an imminent death experience and I just want to know if you think it's possible for me to get rid of this for good.,0
anxiety,The fact that I wasn't born with a generalized anxiety disorder really makes me believe that one day I'll be able to be the person I was before the incident.,0
anxiety,"The problem is that even when I ask my therapist about it, he tells me that my anxiety will always be there from now, I just need to learn how to do it with it.",1
anxiety,I don't talk to anyone in class.,1
anxiety,I avoid people and girls who try to talk to me because I get too nervous and my heart starts to hit.,1
anxiety,I don't talk to a single girl except my sisters and my mother.,1
anxiety,"Today, I connected to my computer to have some games with friends I know.",0
anxiety,"Before the games started, I entered into a discussion with a friend and a few points to remove from the conversation were: - People don't know how to react when I'm there because I'm too sensitive.",0
anxiety,- People don't have the perseverance to keep trying to help.,0
anxiety,- They don't feel like they can help so they've been avoiding me.,1
anxiety,I have gathered the courage to be a little more public I suppose with my problems.,0

anxiety,They're not the kind of jobs I'd like to have \(I kind of want a job where I can talk to other people in the workplace\) but I found that social/community media manager concerts are so flexible and work at home.,0
