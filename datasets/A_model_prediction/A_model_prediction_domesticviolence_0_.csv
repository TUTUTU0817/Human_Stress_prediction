domesticviolence,There was something about the way she said it that seemed a bit off to me - like she had been practising her excuse (or maybe that was in my head).,0

domesticviolence,Like apologizing a lot is a common behavior.,0
domesticviolence,"Knowing about the abuse, I didn't try and correct her or anything (save one time when she thought she was bothering me, and I told her she will never be able to do that).",0

domesticviolence,He told the best stories and cooked the best food and was funny.,0
domesticviolence,All my friends thought he was the coolest person ever.,0
domesticviolence,He also has untreated bipolar disorder.,0
domesticviolence,Anyway - back in December he hit her so bad (using an object) that the next day she passed out at work and her coworkers forced her to get medial attention ) - she went the hospital - her sister went to meet her - and because it was mentioned that a minor lived in the house - social workers and the police got involved.,0

domesticviolence,"I got a message pleading for a conversation, no explanation as to what.",0
domesticviolence,She apologized and stated that she wasn't trying to cause problems.,0
domesticviolence,"She said he was in prison for something that happened a long time ago (looks like he was on felony probation and did something to get it revoked), sent pictures of her children, who are all one year older than the children him and I share, and told me his mother had passed.",0
domesticviolence,Things between us were amicable until that point.,0

domesticviolence,"So, talked to my therapist about this and I had already told the DA I want him to see jail time not just 2 years of probation with state mandated drug treatment.",0
domesticviolence,isn't this also really awful as now they'll just forever say it was because of their addiction and never take full responsibility for their own actions?,1
domesticviolence,"I digress, I demanded that he gives me a face to face apology.",0
domesticviolence,My therapist thinks it might be a bad idea as it's been less than a year and she thinks he will only lie and tell me he's sorry because I've requested it.,1

domesticviolence,It was without exaggeration insanely inspiring.,0
domesticviolence,They then went on to have a slide show with pictures of some of the survivors.,0
domesticviolence,Their pictures would appear as the individual told an abridged version of their story and how this organization helped them.,0

domesticviolence,"Well, last time we fought, I did finally call.",0
domesticviolence,"I was so fucking scared and while he hid in the basement with all the doors locked and light off, the cops took pictures of my hands and neck while I asked them over and over not to arrest him.",0
domesticviolence,They told me it will be up to the judge when he sees the pictures.,0
domesticviolence,"Well, what do you know, he got a warrant.",0
domesticviolence,He didn't show up to the first court date so I know he's in even more trouble now.,1
domesticviolence,"She angrily threw the blanket I wanted on my side of the bed and I told her that I didn't want to sleep in bed any more, so I was going to sleep on the couch.",0
domesticviolence,"She knows that the doctors said not to do that, but she didn't seem to care, which to me is more evidence that she doesn't care that much about my health.",0
domesticviolence,"As I was gathering up my things to leave the room, I got more heated and called her a bitch for caring less about me than the inanimate objects we own.",1
domesticviolence,She got up and literally pushed me.,1

domesticviolence,"Regardless, that didn't last long, maybe half a year.",0
domesticviolence,"I released that apartment, and most of my belongings (I kept a few boxes of my things from the military, personal effects, but little else).",0
domesticviolence,"Looking back, there were some signs of emotional manipulation here, but it was subtle... and you know how it is, love is blind.",0
domesticviolence,We got engaged.,0
domesticviolence,It was quite the affair.,0
domesticviolence,"Also, to answer the million dollar question everyone has, ""How does this happen to someone who outearns her abuser by a factor of 6?""",0
domesticviolence,I wish people talked more about the other side of financial abuse.,0
domesticviolence,"We hear all about the men who financially abuse their partners by prohibiting them from having a job, or denying them access to bank accounts, and that sort of thing.",0
domesticviolence,There's also the side where they monitor every account and become completely terrifying if their higher earning partner so much as buys one cup of coffee that they didn't approve of.,0
domesticviolence,They spend all her money on random crap that they can pass off as household expenses.,0
domesticviolence,"If you withhold financial information from this type of abuser, they will get it out of you somehow.",0
domesticviolence,Trust me.,0
domesticviolence,It isn't pretty.,0
domesticviolence,"I withheld my credit card numbers for a year, and I paid every day for it.",0

domesticviolence,My Daughter was recently in a domestic violence dispute.,0
domesticviolence,The other party was arrested and there was a gun involved.,0

domesticviolence,She has not attempted to move on and is waiting for the order to be lifted in order to reunite with him.,0
domesticviolence,I offered to help but he declined.,0
domesticviolence,After 6 months the debt hadn't moved.,0
domesticviolence,"It was at that time I started asking him more about it, how it was going (I think I was pretty annoying TBH,) and he would say he paid off a large portion of it.",0
domesticviolence,But he didn't and never followed through with the plan.,0
domesticviolence,"i feel badly that I didn't just drop it, but I it felt like he was lying to me.",1
domesticviolence,"he was my best friend since highschool, she was a girl i really liked.",0
domesticviolence,"my parents let him live at my house when his parents kicked him out, and he started dating the girl that i really liked behind my back.",0
domesticviolence,im not gonna go into too much detail about the drama but in short i kicked him out and they both hate me now.,1
domesticviolence,there were some not so nice comments going back and forth.,0
domesticviolence,"the other day they moved into an apartment together after being together for like 3 months, but i just found out through the same person who initially told me that they were dating, his ex gf [22F] that he has hit her on several occasions.",0
domesticviolence,"We're currently looking for separate houses, haven't told the kids but my face is an absolute dogs dinner and will definitely have scarring for life.",0
domesticviolence,"If it was the two of us, we could work it through but my relationship with G after so many telling offs, heart to hearts, explanations about his actions and their consequences, still goads me to get a rise.",0
domesticviolence,"This is a woman who won't back down easily and will portray very intelligent coniving questions which have left me feeling dominated, under control and manipulated for a couple of years now.",0
domesticviolence,The one guiding light for us to work through it is my younger two children and how much I adore them.,0
domesticviolence,"Still,in this current situation, there's is a seemingly insurmountable wall of emotions from all parties which would need a huge amount of effort to even bring us to the negotiating table.",0
domesticviolence,Hey y'all.,0
domesticviolence,Throw away for obvious reasons.,0
domesticviolence,I am so confused and I don't know what to do or who to reach out to.,1
domesticviolence,I started dating my boyfriend two years ago when I moved away from my home to a new state for a job.,0
domesticviolence,"He was funny, intelligent, and *very* charming.",0
domesticviolence,I was silent and looking in his eyes.,0
domesticviolence,"After about 2 minutes, I got off him and headed back to my room.",0
domesticviolence,Just as I was getting to my door he yelled something nasty.,0
domesticviolence,"I said something like ""Go to hell"", and got in my room and closed the door.",0
domesticviolence,He rushed the door and I had to use my body to keep the door closed when he bashed into the door with his body twice.,0
domesticviolence,"once I saw the light, saw that I didn’t even know myself anymore, I shut everything down.",0
domesticviolence,"now, maybe it doesn’t seem like all sociopaths are this way.",0
domesticviolence,but they are if you let them.,0
domesticviolence,have the strength to say no.,0
domesticviolence,have the strength to be YOU.,0

domesticviolence,She desperately needs to see an oncologist or something about these tumors she's developed.,0
domesticviolence,It's breaking my heart seeing her like this.,1
domesticviolence,"Other family members, all of whom are in Canada agree that going back to Canada (we moved to Texas in 95) would be good but her excuse is that there's no jobs.",0
domesticviolence,Also her not having a passport (it use to only be a green card required to travel across the border to Canada) is probably deterring that option.,0
domesticviolence,Thank you Reddit.,0
domesticviolence,Some details changed for anonymity.,0
domesticviolence,"Also, let me know if there's a better place for me to post this.",0
domesticviolence,My wife and I are trying to help a family member in an abuse situation.,0

domesticviolence,"About 2 weeks later, the post was gone and suddenly all was well and she is posting sappy/happy posts with him.",0
domesticviolence,"I sent her a private message on Facebook asking her if everything was okay and if there was anything I could do, letting her know I was genuinely worried.",0

domesticviolence,She's shown us pictures of bruises.,0

domesticviolence,No I’m not.,0
domesticviolence,What I am saying though is that man and woman were designed to have a mate.,0

domesticviolence,Best wishes to all.,0
domesticviolence,"An app made sense for this, since so many people have a phone.",0
domesticviolence,But sometimes a solution can raise more problems!,0
domesticviolence,"If we had an app that says ""domestic violence escape plan,"" and if the abuser checks the user's phone, that's even worse than a paper form.",0

domesticviolence,"He never pursued it, though.",0
domesticviolence,"She claims that because she is a woman, nobody will believe me.",0

domesticviolence,"They can’t all be wrong or insane, can they?",0
domesticviolence,Abusers spend so long abusing and being nice and abusing and being nice that you start to think that you play a role in the abuse and the only reason he/she is nice to you again is because of some demand you met.,0

domesticviolence,He would see that I defended my mom and since I called the police one time (I found him choking her onto the wall) he stopped hurting her and transitioned into beating me.,0
domesticviolence,Now I know you guys may ask why did you continue to allow the abuse with you if you had stopped it with your mother before?,0
domesticviolence,Well I have an answer  to that my mother loved my father very much and every time I tried contacting the police she would stop me and I have a lot of love towards my mother and would do anything for her... but anyways back to the present we no longer live with him anymore and we have cut all ties with him except for my brother.,0
domesticviolence,Above all else he made me feel not that I owed him for such affections.,0
domesticviolence,"He made me feel worth something, that I was important and beautiful.",0
domesticviolence,He gave me back my soul and so very much more until I married him.,0
domesticviolence,I know this story might not be what you want to read – I didn’t fight the good fight by myself.,0

domesticviolence,"Husband, I wanted to do this amicably.",0
domesticviolence,We could have made it through this heartbreak to our mutual benefit.,0
domesticviolence,I was willing to give you everything in exchange for your helping me furnish a tiny studio apartment.,0

domesticviolence,I was going to let you keep my puppy.,0
domesticviolence,He said you better get a job by Friday or the homeless shelter.,0
domesticviolence,I'm thinking of going to stay at my cousins place who is supportive but it's a tad dirty but I'm considering just packing up my bag left clothes and going to stay with him.,0
domesticviolence,He also has my car and I'm not gonna try to take it back because he paid for my head so he gets my car.,1
domesticviolence,It's not worth much but still.,0

domesticviolence,The girl turns around in pushes him out of frustration and can tell it wasn't meant to hurt him or anything.,1
domesticviolence,"The guy reciprocates by immediately pushing her multiple times, and they were NOT soft pushes, and seems like he was trying to push her to the ground.",0
domesticviolence,"Couple pushes in, I was in shock, by the fact that you could really be in a relationship with someone that is abusive or that physically hurts you, or maybe it was that moment, she found out who he really was.",0
domesticviolence,"She got up immediately and walked the opposite direction, walking back towards me, and I try not to look at her but she was just devastated I can tell.",0

domesticviolence,"I tried to talk to him and update him on the pregnancy, and ask him to be involved for the good of our child, and he literally looked through me without saying a word.",0
domesticviolence,"3 months after our daughter was born, I texted him and told him that he was absent on the most amazing person in the world, and how it wasn't fair for her.",0
domesticviolence,"The last interaction we had, he moved.",0
domesticviolence,"The night before, he strangled me.",0
domesticviolence,We had a toxic but especially loving relationship.,0
domesticviolence,"He really tried to love me as much as possible, but he was getting drunk and verbally abusive.",0
domesticviolence,Babies don't care about the hours of work you know.,0
domesticviolence,The husband finally says that he will look at our darling for the few hours between his complete sleep and work.,0
domesticviolence,So we do.,0
domesticviolence,"I'm doing shavings on an embroidery project doing me' time, he's on the bed with baby keep the creeping crazy busy.",0
domesticviolence,He falls asleep and baby almost falls into the crack between the head of bed and the wall.,0
domesticviolence,"Even when (now talking about other times) I tried to be playful and like the dreadful stuff, he was beating me for it.",0
domesticviolence,And I've always looked at him for some reason.,0
domesticviolence,I think no child should ever experience that kind of thing.,0

domesticviolence,"We've also been busy building partnerships in the security sector, which will allow us to bring even more resources to the audience we serve.",0
domesticviolence,"When I asked her how it happened, she said that her brother accidentally bowed her to the face when they were ""burning.""",0
domesticviolence,There was something about the way she said it that seemed a little far away - as she had practiced her excuse (or maybe it was in my head).,0
domesticviolence,"Anyway, it may have seemed a bit weird to me that a couple of 20 brothers and sisters would argue with each other like 10 years old children.",0
domesticviolence,"This morning, after a few days' absence, she arrived at the office with a broken wrist.",0
domesticviolence,"It was summer, I had just started a new job as a bartender.",0
domesticviolence,"I met a girl who was just as strange, had a lot of similar interests, was looking for the same thing I was.",0
domesticviolence,We quickly got excited with each other.,0
domesticviolence,It didn't take us long to move in together.,0
domesticviolence,u mind you my mom has 5=1 and he has 5=9.,0
domesticviolence,now his jaw hurts and pops when she opens it wide.,0
domesticviolence,so this is my dilemma: I am a very emotional person.,0
domesticviolence,my emotional skin is raw and any slight change in others affects me greatly.,0
domesticviolence,parallel note: I had developed ptsd growing up being afraid of my older brother (seeing him and hearing him fighting with my family several times growing up) but since he moved away for good (hopefully) his departure.,0

domesticviolence,"The first 2 was long distance, but then I moved from NY to TX to be with her.",0
domesticviolence,Everything was fine until we moved into a new apartment in December.,0
domesticviolence,It's not the best but it's a roof on our heads and it's relatively cheap.,0
domesticviolence,I was really sick and I had to go to the hospital and he refused to come visit me when I was home.,0
domesticviolence,He told me that I was dense to expect him to come with me when I had such a deadly disease (it was MRSA and not so deadly).,0
domesticviolence,"She asked to go to the bathroom right away, and we helped her with that.",0
domesticviolence,The husband/driver was out loading all our rooms when she finally got out of the bathroom.,0
domesticviolence,We asked her what's wrong.,0
domesticviolence,"She said, ""He grabbed me by the neck and hurt me.",0
domesticviolence,"I don't think I can go back with him.""",1
domesticviolence,I've never used this number before.,0
domesticviolence,"Not like the triggers by saying, because I should ask her about it, but more general behaviors.",0
domesticviolence,"Like, if I see her acting in a way that is common to victims of abuse, I should know to be careful about it.",0
domesticviolence,As apologizing much is a common behavior.,0
domesticviolence,"Knowing about abuse, I have not tried to correct it or anything (save once she thought she was bothering me, and I told her she will never be able to do it).",0
domesticviolence,"So, any additional information is useful.",0
domesticviolence,Everyone loved him.,0
domesticviolence,He told the best stories and cooked the best food and was funny.,0
domesticviolence,All my friends thought he was the coolest person ever.,0
domesticviolence,He also untreated the bipolar disorder.,0
domesticviolence,"Anyway - in December, he hit him so badly (using an object) that the next day she fainted at work and her colleagues forced him to get media attention) - she went to the hospital - her sister went to meet her - and because it was mentioned that a minor lived in the house - social workers and the police were involved.",0
domesticviolence,My grandmother was telling me stories about having to be the one who cleaned the blood from the walls.,0

domesticviolence,She apologized and said that she was not trying to cause problems.,0
domesticviolence,"She said that he was in prison for something that had happened a long time ago (it seems that he was on criminal probation and did something to get him revoked), she sent photos of her children, who are all one year older than the children he and I share, and told me that his mother had died.",0
domesticviolence,Things between us were friendly up to this point.,0
domesticviolence,"Now, the atmosphere is very different.",0
domesticviolence,"It hurts now because she acts indifferent and as if she wasn't completely affected (what she might be, I don't know if she's pretending).",0
domesticviolence,"She's already passed on to someone else, someone she's loved for a while, her boss.",0
domesticviolence,She's tried three times to bring her in and tell me about her.,0

domesticviolence,"When I was 16, I met a guy on vacation 11 years old, my eldest... having never been able to hear me with those in my age group, I didn't think of anyone older who was spending time with me, because I had always spent my time with the adults on vacation or my older brother's friends...",0
domesticviolence,"Rethinking now, I know it was naive and innocent on my part, that no one could or should not blame a young child, as I really thought I was a pariah among my peers.",0
domesticviolence,"And even if it was perhaps true, there is no reason or excuse for a 27-year-old man to want to be with a 16-year-old girl, except that he could not find a woman his age who would fall for his games and lies...",0
domesticviolence,He played well for my vacation... respecting my limits and acting only as a friend.,0

domesticviolence,"She has always said that money is a problem, and I'm an idiot said that I care about it I'm going to make a plan so that this evil doesn't have to be in our lives, She calls me to say that prosecutors need $250 for a letter from Eviction to him.",0
domesticviolence,He said he never loved us.,0
domesticviolence,He recognizes and plays with his daughter from his age of six months.,0
domesticviolence,He uses to threaten to take him off of me.,1
domesticviolence,"He becomes delusional at times and he yells at me, if you don't admit that you're going to call the cops on me for calling the director at McDonalds an asshole!",1
domesticviolence,"So I have a buddy who still lives with his stepfather, mom and brother.",0
domesticviolence,"Anyway, I just found out through him that his stepfather hits him and sometimes his mother.",0
domesticviolence,He went out when he was drunk with other behaviors.,0
domesticviolence,When my friend gets drunk he likes to make people worse until they try to beat him and until recently I just thought he liked to fight.,0
domesticviolence,She gave birth to a beautiful little girl in November 2017.,0
domesticviolence,Her partner is 26 years old and has had many tips with the law.,0
domesticviolence,"When he met my friend, he was under house arrest for a previous charge.",0
domesticviolence,They worked together and soon started to go out.,0
domesticviolence,My friend is a Filipino woman and her partner is a Jamaican man.,0
domesticviolence,And it's okay to fall and have a bad day- as long as you take yourself and keep working to move forward.,0
domesticviolence,Moving forward does not mean forgiving and forgetting or tolerating any behavior.,0
domesticviolence,Moving forward is about YOU and starting to live the life you deserve.,0
domesticviolence,You're beautiful.,0
domesticviolence,You're smart.,0
domesticviolence,"In any event, he denied that his insurance was not covered by anyone in this state, and that it was illegal for him to refuse his service.",0
domesticviolence,My SO had already spoken to his HR chief.,0
domesticviolence,They had already decided that there was not much they could do unless she came to him.,0
domesticviolence,"Then tonight, the HR chief is seriously worried about his safety (and my SO) in a way he wasn't before.",0
domesticviolence,"If you have a family that loves you, treat them properly -- because there is someone who would have given me what it took for you to give him what you needed.",0
domesticviolence,"My first marriage didn't work, but I tried.",0
domesticviolence,"And my second was beautiful, we've been together for almost 18 years, we've been married for 16 years.",0
domesticviolence,"We still have a lot of fun and although she doesn't understand what we've been through in the first hand, she perfectly supported me and we built a good life together.",0
domesticviolence,My mother never had another relationship.,0
domesticviolence,"I was in a relationship, so I didn't really let him go anywhere, but in hell, it was a new experience for me, and I liked to be loved.",0
domesticviolence,Fast forward half a year at my break up.,0
domesticviolence,"She had moved to another job, but we met in Wal-Mart, if all the places.",0
domesticviolence,"We succeeded, and it wasn't long before a date turned into two, then more.",0

domesticviolence,His mother and aunt like me too.,0
domesticviolence,"But there have been dark parts of our relationships, of which I am stunned to speak.",0
domesticviolence,"First of all, the lightest part - when he is nervous because of something, he hits me in the form of severe criticism.",0
domesticviolence,Or he screams.,0
domesticviolence,'You always look at your phone!!!',0
domesticviolence,"To begin with, I feel like I should share why I wanted to be here today to read this statement myself.",0
domesticviolence,"For six and a half years, I was in a relationship with Luis.",0
domesticviolence,"The first time he physically assaulted me, I was 18 years old.",0
domesticviolence,This was the first time I had been struck unconscious by another human.,0
domesticviolence,"Apart from that, it really bothers you when the prosecutor calls you and tells you that in less than a week your aggressor will plead as a last resort; if you want to attend, please come for at least half a day to see what will happen.",0
domesticviolence,"So, talk to my therapist about it and I had already told the prosecutor I want him to see not only 2 years probation with the mandated state drug treatment.",0
domesticviolence,is not as terrible as now they'll just say forever it was because of their addiction and never take full responsibility for their own actions?,0
domesticviolence,"I digress, I demanded that he give me a face to excuse faces.",0
domesticviolence,"My sister sent me a message: ""CALL ME"" I received her message at 1:00 a.m. when I woke up at home to use the bathroom.",0
domesticviolence,"I called my sister at that time, she answered the phone and I heard screaming and screaming.",0
domesticviolence,"I'm the only one who saw this side of her, maybe I'm just the cause.",0
domesticviolence,"To add to the story, she left me with scars on my arms a few months ago while I was trying to calm her down while giving her kisses.",0
domesticviolence,She dug her nails inside me quite severely.,0
domesticviolence,"I had pictures that the officers asked to see, which I showed them.",0

domesticviolence,He is dating a woman with a drug problem and a criminal record.,0
domesticviolence,He met her three weeks ago and took their son to sleep at her residence (unknown to my parent until recently).,0
domesticviolence,On Monday he told her that he was seeking divorce.,0
domesticviolence,They basically had a few speakers who went from the organization's people to the mayor and state officials.,0
domesticviolence,Then they had a short film about the director who was retiring and essentially how she turned this small group barely funded into a surprisingly useful and essential part of the community.,0
domesticviolence,It was without exaggeration wildly inspiring.,0
domesticviolence,They then had a slideshow with pictures of some of the survivors.,0
domesticviolence,Their photos would appear as the individual told an abbreviated version of their story and how this organization helped them.,0
domesticviolence,"When you first come face to face with a sociopath, you will be completely ignorant of who they really are.They will be who they think you want them to be.They are false.Maybe it took him some time to show you his colors TRUE,maybe he was pretty close to the beginning.But the most important moment was when you connected to the beginning.",0
domesticviolence,But someone asked me if I needed a shirt and gave me one.,0
domesticviolence,I asked to call my mother but she couldn't understand what I was saying so he told her.,0
domesticviolence,The ambulance arrived and I told the cops that my boyfriend had beaten me but I wasn't giving any more information.,0
domesticviolence,"The ambulance lady told me that if I refused to go with her, she would take me against my will because I was exposing signs of head trauma.",0
domesticviolence,"The last time we had a fight, I finally called.",0
domesticviolence,"I was so scared and while he was hiding in the basement with all the locked and lit doors, the cops took pictures of my hands and neck while I asked them not to stop him.",0
domesticviolence,"She pissed off the blanket I wanted on my side of the bed and I told her I didn't want to sleep in bed anymore, so I was going to sleep on the couch.",0
domesticviolence,"She knows that the doctors said not to do this, but she didn't seem to care about it, which is more proof for me that she doesn't care much about my health.",0
domesticviolence,"While I was gathering my stuff to leave the room, I got warmed up and treated her as a slut for taking less care of me than the inanimate items we own.",0
domesticviolence,She got up and literally pushed me.,1
domesticviolence,"I'm not very tall, and while I was reclining for a while, she finally pushed me out of the room and slammed the door.",0
domesticviolence,I thought he loved me.,0
domesticviolence,"I didn't know why, but he told me often, on the phone, by letter.",0
domesticviolence,I was the girl he thought he could never get.,0
domesticviolence,I was out of his league (his words).,0
domesticviolence,"I have to find some kind of balance here, between living my life and keeping my fear in check.",0
domesticviolence,God bless all you who have been through DV and abuse - I really wish you the best in your lives and recoveries.,0
domesticviolence,We are all heroes here.,0
domesticviolence,xx,0
domesticviolence,"Anyway, it didn't last long, maybe half a year.",0
domesticviolence,"I released this apartment, and most of my stuff (I kept a few boxes of my army stuff, personal effects, but few others).",0
domesticviolence,"Looking back, there were some signs of emotional manipulation here, but it was subtle... and you know how it is, love is blind.",0
domesticviolence,"So, to answer the question of millions of dollars everyone has, ""How does it happen to someone who surpasses his attacker by a factor of six?""",0
domesticviolence,I want people to talk more about financial abuse on the other side.,0
domesticviolence,"We hear everything about the men who abuse their partners financially by prohibiting them from having a job, or denying them access to bank accounts, and that kind of thing.",0
domesticviolence,There's also the side where they monitor each account and become completely terrifying if their partner wins so much as buying a cup of coffee that they haven't approved.,0
domesticviolence,"If you keep financial information from this type of abuser, they will get it from you somehow.",0
domesticviolence,Believe me.,0
domesticviolence,It's not nice.,0
domesticviolence,"I refused my credit card numbers for a year, and I paid for it every day.",0
domesticviolence,"Anyway, I'm totally date at this point, but it was really amazing to find someone in this whole world who actually confirmed that what I experienced trying to access the help was real.",0
domesticviolence,My daughter was recently in a domestic violence conflict.,0
domesticviolence,The other party was arrested and there was a gun involved.,0
domesticviolence,They are both less than 21.,0
domesticviolence,The sentence will be soon and the court said he gets the probation and at the time of sentencing the order of absence of contact will be lifted.,0
domesticviolence,"After six months, the debt had not moved.",0
domesticviolence,"It was at that time that I started asking him more about it, how it was (I think I was pretty boring TBH,) and he would say he paid a lot of it.",0
domesticviolence,But he didn't do it and never followed the plan.,0
domesticviolence,"I feel bad that I didn't let him down, but I felt he was lying to me.",1
domesticviolence,"He was my best friend since high school, she was a girl I really loved.",0
domesticviolence,"my parents let him live at home when his parents threw him out, and he started dating the girl I really loved behind my back.",0
domesticviolence,"im is not going to get into too much details about the drama, but in short I fired him out and they both hate me now.",0
domesticviolence,There were some not so nice comments going and coming.,0
domesticviolence,"the other day, they moved into an apartment together after having been together for about 3 months, but I just found out by the same person who first told me that they were going out, his former GF [22F] that he hit him several times.",0
domesticviolence,"We are currently looking for separate homes, have not told the children, but my face is an absolute dog dinner and will certainly have scars for life.",0
domesticviolence,"If it was us both, we could work through but my relationship with G after so many stories, heart-to-hearts, explanations about its actions and their consequences, still seeks to get an increase.",0
domesticviolence,"It is a woman who will not come back easily and will represent very intelligent conivant questions that have left me dominated, under control and manipulated for some years now.",0
domesticviolence,I'm so confused and I don't know what to do or who to talk to.,1
domesticviolence,I started dating my boyfriend two years ago when I moved from home to a new state for a job.,0
domesticviolence,"He was funny, smart and *very* charming.",0
domesticviolence,I was silent and looking in his eyes.,0
domesticviolence,"After about 2 minutes, I came down from him and went back to my room.",0
domesticviolence,"Just as I was arriving at my door, he shouted something bad.",0
domesticviolence,"I said something like ""Go to hell"", and I entered my room and closed the door.",0
domesticviolence,He rushed the door and I had to use my body to keep the door closed when he hit the door with his body twice.,0
domesticviolence,"Once I saw the light, since I didn't even know myself anymore, I closed everything.",0
domesticviolence,"Now, maybe it doesn't seem like all sociopaths are that way, but they are if you let them.",0
domesticviolence,have the strength to say no.,0
domesticviolence,have the strength to be YOU.,0
domesticviolence,"I don't know anyone else in my family on either side, except my mother, my father and my brother.",0
domesticviolence,"I've never really been close to anyone in my entire life, apart from my grandparents on my mother's side, and my music teacher.",0
domesticviolence,Except my grandparents died when I was 8 (both within 5 months of the other) and my music teacher had to quit his job because he was struggling economically.,0
domesticviolence,She desperately needs to see an oncologist or something about these tumors she has developed.,0
domesticviolence,It breaks my heart to see her like this.,1
domesticviolence,"Other family members, who are all in Canada, agree that returning to Canada (we moved to Texas in 95) would be good, but her excuse is that there are no jobs.",0
domesticviolence,Some details have changed for anonymity.,0
domesticviolence,"Also, let me know if there's a better place for me to post this.",0
domesticviolence,My wife and I are trying to help a family member in a situation of abuse.,0
domesticviolence,"I'm going to call him Amanda and his ""boyfriend"" John.",0
domesticviolence,Amanda and John live a few hours away.,0
domesticviolence,"Yes, you should!",0
domesticviolence,And we have planned for that.,0
domesticviolence,"Because the data is stored in an encrypted Google Firebase server, you can download the application again and use their same username and password to recover their plan.",0
domesticviolence,"So, if you go to Walmart to get a burner phone (or when we provide one, in some cases), you can install it on this device as well.",0

domesticviolence,"He finally leaves me inside and we start talking (he's drunk as always, our schedules differ by a few hours so every time I got home at the age of 6, he was still drunk).",0
domesticviolence,He's sitting against my counter calling me names and I slam his chest.,1
domesticviolence,Worse mistake of my life.,0
domesticviolence,I should never have hit him.,1

domesticviolence,"I sent her a private message on Facebook asking her if everything was okay and if there was anything I could do, letting her know I was really worried.",0
domesticviolence,He said all these things.,0
domesticviolence,I don't currently have a passport.,0
domesticviolence,He sent it because the tax return has to be filed.,0
domesticviolence,Whatever it is.,0
domesticviolence,I am British.,0
domesticviolence,"John often refuses his prescription drugs very necessary to get his way, which is super shitty.",0
domesticviolence,"Recently she had a small financial fall and he became super nice and after they passed all this, he came back.",0
domesticviolence,He is extremely manipulative and abusive.,0
domesticviolence,She showed us pictures of bruises.,0
domesticviolence,"The plan at the moment is that she will get her prescription sent somewhere near us, then while John is at work, she leaves with her service dog, meets us in our car and we take him home at a few hours.",0
domesticviolence,"What I say, however, is that the man and the woman were designed to have a spouse.",0
domesticviolence,A spouse who completes you and makes you happy.,0
domesticviolence,A spouse that you can love and be loved by.,0
domesticviolence,"I never looked for a man to make me happy or to be my knight in brilliant armor, but he found me anyway.",0
domesticviolence,I had problems with a friend and thought that the perspective of a stranger might be useful.,0
domesticviolence,"It has always been a little too emotional and control, having previously been very easy to anger, and having previously followed me and an ex by my phone, and passing through my business without my knowledge to check texts etc.",0
domesticviolence,This has really worsened recently.,0
domesticviolence,Maybe a year or two arguments because a regular event when we had drunk.,0
domesticviolence,"I had to take care of her after explosions like this on many occasions, the worst being a visit to the hospital when she flew away and I found her in a parking lot, having fallen and hitting her head.",0

domesticviolence,He said it today.,0
domesticviolence,By texting when I was on the phone with the driver's control.,0
domesticviolence,"It makes me think he's psychic or something, because every time I do anything to try to get past this relationship, for me, it's like he knows it.",1

domesticviolence,Thank you very much in advance.,0
domesticviolence,"send hope, love, courage and so many prayers for everyone during this season of your life.",0

domesticviolence,"Today, he cried and begged me not to leave him (which I had already done) etc.",0

domesticviolence,I've never been comfortable with the level of her drink or her personal choices and I'm living away from her.,1
domesticviolence,I'm trying to push her in more positive directions and over the last 18 months have offered her a few hundred monthly financial supports to help her better support her.,0
domesticviolence,"About 6 months ago, it came out that her boyfriend yelled in her face and put her hands on her.",0
domesticviolence,"Usually, she beats her as much or worse - I think it's pure madness and I told her that she needs to make physical contact a ""red line"" and if I've heard of it, I'd call the local police office and I'd report it.",0
domesticviolence,He abused his ex-girlfriends too.,0
domesticviolence,"I left him last June, after trying to kill me after being released from a one-week sentence for DV.",0

domesticviolence,"Today at work, I took a client's payment over the phone.",0
domesticviolence,I took his account so there was a moment of silence between us.,0
domesticviolence,"I could hear a man in the back screaming, ""I'm going to slap you"" I didn't tell him that I had his page stopped so I could continue to listen, because I was convinced that I had misheard.",0
domesticviolence,"""Bitch I'm going to slap you"" a few seconds of silence, ""I don't care"", a few seconds of silence, ""I'm going to slap you"" finally I said ma'am.",0

domesticviolence,Finally safe.,0
domesticviolence,"No pillow or cozy though, just a thin blanket and a clean laundry.",0
domesticviolence,"Anyway, I couldn't fall asleep.",0
domesticviolence,"At about 6 o'clock, I dung out, took a shower, collected most of his things that I could find and left him a note saying I took his key, and when I was back at 8 o'clock, he should be gone and everything he left behind goes to the trash.",0
