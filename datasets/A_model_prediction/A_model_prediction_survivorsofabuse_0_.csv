survivorsofabuse,"I thought eating pizza would be a good idea after the alcohol, so I followed him inside.",0
survivorsofabuse,"These weren't the only punishments, though.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes he'd make us choose a favorite toy or plushie to be thrown out if we'd made him mad, and one time when he caught me rescuing my plushie, he slapped me across the face, then made me watch him cut her into little pieces, standing there at 1 in the morning berating me about how I was a stupid, ignorant little bitch that needed right and wrong beaten into her, because I was too stupid to to know how to do as I was told.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Sometimes, though, he'd not just snap and get angry...",0
survivorsofabuse,He'd utterly lose control of himself.,1
survivorsofabuse,"Screaming so furiously I couldn't really understand him, grabbing me by the arms/shoulders and shaking me hard enough to give me whiplash, and continue screaming over me once I collapsed in a cowering heap when he let go.",1

survivorsofabuse,"Every sport he played, she cheered.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Through rain, sleet, snow, and sunshine she was in the stands proudly cheering him on.",0
survivorsofabuse,In their own little world they were in love.,0
survivorsofabuse,The worst he's ever done is yell.,0
survivorsofabuse,He does not seek out confrontation and he certainly doesn't threaten people.,0
survivorsofabuse,That's not to say he couldn't hold his own in a fight.,0
survivorsofabuse,My uncle apparently got the message and started crying and begged for forgiveness.,0
survivorsofabuse,"My dad told him that he believes he could eventually forgive him, but that doesn't mean he would have anything to do with him.",0

survivorsofabuse,"I went to sleep and woke up to it saying, ""fine, I guess we'll see other people, then!""",0
survivorsofabuse,I tend not to like driving long distances in cars with people in unfamiliar places still but I feel good just that I am back on the road even if I don't drive the car.,0
survivorsofabuse,This took me about five years to reach this level of comfort.,0
survivorsofabuse,All of my fears:  I started to exercise hard every single day.,0

survivorsofabuse,"He's exactly what I've needed, maintains his side of an equal partnership, etc.",0
survivorsofabuse,"My only problem is that, though our sex life is great, I catch myself being overly sexual sometimes, even if he shows no interest that occasional day, then feeling extremely hurt and rejected if he says that he doesn't want to do anything that day.",0
survivorsofabuse,"It's not like we never do anything, I just seem to still be attached to this idea.",0
survivorsofabuse,He shows me he loves me in many different ways but this is so hurtful when I'm aware that it's ridiculous to have these expectations.,1
survivorsofabuse,I guess I'm afraid I'll never stop feeling this way and I'll end up hurt him.,1
survivorsofabuse,"So I am okay at making short-term acquaintances, but can't seem to make friends beyond professional relationships, polite greetings, small-talk, etc.",0
survivorsofabuse,I'm sure it's because I have no practice at making friends and the history of relationships I have had feel laced with feelings of betrayal - so maybe I'm self-sabotaging a little bit.,1
survivorsofabuse,"But gosh, I would like someone to talk to about day to day life, hopes, worries, goals, etc.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Also, I have an eleven year old son for whom I would like to model some more healthy platonic relationships.",0
survivorsofabuse,"I work in a field that requires little one-on-one contact, rely on walking/public transportation, and have a busy schedule with kids activities, work, community meetings, so those factors make it extra hard.",0

survivorsofabuse,We have spoiled my daughter rotten.,0
survivorsofabuse,"Designer clothes, designer makeup, way too much freedom, gym membership, and anything else a 14 year old girl could ever want.",0
survivorsofabuse,I think a lot of that comes from the fact that we were not able to provide her with anything for so long.,0
survivorsofabuse,She wrapped her arms around me and cried for dear life I growled at him to stop at once for he had scared her..he tried to take her from me as he continued to yell and she would not let him touch her That was the final straw.,1

survivorsofabuse,"This is why I was hoping that, if you are interested, you could send me stories of your experiences in an abusive relationship - whatever detail you choose to send, it doesn't have to be anything ""epic"" and ""grand,"" it could be the smallest segment that you hold significance to.",0

survivorsofabuse,Were I abused as a child?,0
survivorsofabuse,He accidentally held my throat too tight and the marks of his affections remained on my long after he was a memory.,0
survivorsofabuse,He pulled out my tears and scared my face pale so not one person could see the marks of blood left on my neck.,0
survivorsofabuse,Then my world was dipped in white tint so no one could observe the taint behind my devastation.,0
survivorsofabuse,The color of my skin and the color of the fear were almost a perfect match although my fear was clearly a shade lighter than what was underneath.,0

survivorsofabuse,I met Zach and James.,0
survivorsofabuse,We were roughly the same age.,0
survivorsofabuse,"James was a top-notcher, consistent honour student ever since 1st grade, and had a younger sister who was in 2nd grade at the time.",0
survivorsofabuse,"However, Zach wasn't that smart, he was average, yet very decent and very cool.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Fast forward to our first quarter test, after finishing all my exams during the day, James asked me, out of the blue, ""Saan mo mas gusto?",0
survivorsofabuse,"He did threaten to walk out when I tried to crack a third, and I stopped.",0
survivorsofabuse,"He says this is so rewarding for him, but is really open about how tough it has been as well.",0
survivorsofabuse,"The therapist, though she is more closed mouthed and less personally emotional, has said she has required supervision several times over me.",0
survivorsofabuse,"No matter how nice they are, if I fuck up months of progress, decisions about where this is going seem likely.",0
survivorsofabuse,Getting this out seems to have helped a fair bit.,0
survivorsofabuse,At 26... it was a roller coaster ride.,0
survivorsofabuse,It was great at the start... then I caught him with someone else at a party.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I broke up there and then, realised I couldn't let go... we got back together, we broke up, he became abusive... it went downhill from there.",1

survivorsofabuse,Their grades started to slip.,0
survivorsofabuse,I was asking the right questions but they kept saying nothing was going on.,0
survivorsofabuse,Fast forward six months.,0
survivorsofabuse,You try harder to focus on the screen when another turns on.,0
survivorsofabuse,The screen is large enough that you can clearly make out that it is most definitely a memory.,0
survivorsofabuse,"The more you focus, the more screens turn on all showing the same memory.",0
survivorsofabuse,"The last screen is so clear, the picture so perfect that it's almost like you are there.",0
survivorsofabuse,"As you watch, you realize that you aren't watching anymore- you are in the memory again.",0
survivorsofabuse,It didn’t seem innocent.,0
survivorsofabuse,It looked like he’d seen something like that before and wanted someone to try it on.,0
survivorsofabuse,"My parents were more strict and didn’t let me watch much things with violence, etc., and his were more lax, so maybe that was a factor.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Also, he was the golden child in my extended family: charming, comedic, artistic.",0
survivorsofabuse,He got a pass a LOT.,0
survivorsofabuse,"When I was one, my parents got divorced.",0
survivorsofabuse,My parents HATE each other so I have never had a good relationship with either of them.,0

survivorsofabuse,He would make me pull down my pants and he would whip me until I was hysterically crying in pain.,0
survivorsofabuse,"We are 21 now, both turning 22 next month.",0
survivorsofabuse,"It started off as friendly catching up, but things have gotten more romantic and we have been hanging out a lot more.",0
survivorsofabuse,"I wasn’t sure we could ever be together again, but I no longer have feelings of sadness or resentment regarding what he did to me.",0
survivorsofabuse,"I have noticed by the way he carries himself now, he has definitely matured.",0
survivorsofabuse,I guess I just want to know when or if I should tell him I hooked up with his friends?,1
survivorsofabuse,I turned 15 shortly after meeting him.,0
survivorsofabuse,He started out so kind and loving.,0
survivorsofabuse,And then it just... turned.,0
survivorsofabuse,"It turned from compliments into me not being able to wear certain things, say certain things, do certain things.",0
survivorsofabuse,"I was barely allowed to be online, no longer able to post anything relating to the music I used to create before him.",0
survivorsofabuse,We were raised in the Bible belt and she believed every word they told her about it being normal.,0
survivorsofabuse,I tried so hard to explain it to her over the years.,0
survivorsofabuse,She never understood.,0
survivorsofabuse,Even now she barely talks to me because I'm the 'outcast' for standing against what my family has done.,1
survivorsofabuse,We were so close when were younger because it's all we had.,0
survivorsofabuse,"They've done a lot that's cut down my self-esteem and such, but they've also done a lot for me too.",0

survivorsofabuse,"My mother isn't that bad, but my father is the worst.",0
survivorsofabuse,"When I dare to open up to my friends, they tell me ‘Oh, my brother used to fight with me too’ and I feel diminished and dismissed.",0
survivorsofabuse,Since I left home at 21 and moved to the other side of the country I tried to talk up my family.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I started from a place of recognising their vulnerability, justifying their actions by saying they were distracted by our financial woes and my dads early onset dementia.",0
survivorsofabuse,I told everyone they were amazing people.,0
survivorsofabuse,For the past two decades I have fought my body.,0
survivorsofabuse,"But those are your most valuable skills, they are your surviving skills.",0
survivorsofabuse,"And yeah, not everyone has them.",0
survivorsofabuse,Here is how you can translate your survivor skills into your further success.,0

survivorsofabuse,"I hope you enjoyed reading this (as morbid as it sounds) but this was the hardest to write, a step forward to finally making it public.",0
survivorsofabuse,I have quite a few things going on for the next couple of weeks so will be taking a break from writing.,0
survivorsofabuse,Expect the next part around the 15th.,0
survivorsofabuse,"We have dinner, we get drinks, and I agree to try again.",0
survivorsofabuse,"I want to say here, I have never had this kind of behavior before.",0
survivorsofabuse,"When I’ve broken up with someone, or had them break up with me, even if I’m heartbroken I’ve always been done.",1
survivorsofabuse,So I don’t know what the disconnect is here.,0
survivorsofabuse,It’s been a little over two weeks now we’ve been seeing each other again.,0
survivorsofabuse,Eventually he did it less.,0
survivorsofabuse,"He would also make direct eye contact with me when he was seducing my mother, which filled me with so much rage.",0
survivorsofabuse,This happened throughout my adolescence.,0
survivorsofabuse,He acted hurt or offended because I always had my guard up around him.,0
survivorsofabuse,"After I moved out to go to college, he let me know I wasn’t welcome to stay at their house anymore because I “treated them like shit”.",0
survivorsofabuse,I truly hope it finds it's way in the hands of the ones most in need.,0

survivorsofabuse,"But this girl, man oh man I really liked her.",0
survivorsofabuse,We spoke at first about nothing in special but quickly it got really personal and in depth.,0
survivorsofabuse,"One night, early, early into this, we were kind of flirting.",0
survivorsofabuse,He suggested we shower together.,0
survivorsofabuse,I was scared.,1
survivorsofabuse,Uncomfortable.,0
survivorsofabuse,Not sure.,0
survivorsofabuse,my mom hollered at me to come help with something in the kitchen.,0
survivorsofabuse,I went slowly feeling like I was missing out on the fun.,0
survivorsofabuse,i purpously wasn't being much help to my mom and being the little bitch that I was seeing that she had my brother on her hip as she was trying to get the stuff ready to grill she just waved me away and told me to go on then.,0
survivorsofabuse,so i walked outside and stood on the back stoop and watched.,0
survivorsofabuse,"he smiled at me, and took off his shirt, then his shoes, his socks and then his pants.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Lily is a really nice person (atleast, I'll continue to believe she is), and I think she might be open to it.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Apparently, Mina and Lily have known eachother since childhood.",0
survivorsofabuse,I still think there's a bond there.,0
survivorsofabuse,"I want to look up a professional too, or some kinda of therapist, someone to help her and give her real advice, not my under-educated whims.",0
survivorsofabuse,"If I could get some resources, that would really helpful.",0
survivorsofabuse,"He and I have been pretty ""huggy"" the last couple years, and since he scared me I cut all physical contact off completely.",0
survivorsofabuse,"He didn't try to initiate it today even though we won't be seeing each other for several weeks, so that's something.",0
survivorsofabuse,I don't plan on allowing any of it for the forseeable future - maybe unless I feel like he's really learned something or changed somehow.,0
survivorsofabuse,I don't plan on staying the night at his place or letting him stay at mine.,0
survivorsofabuse,"Probably will limit our contact to public or ""other people present"" for the most part.",0

survivorsofabuse,"She told me that when I was born, I gave her the best orgasm of her life.",0

survivorsofabuse,"&#x200B; However...  Over those seven years, there's been a lot of turmoil for me.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Nana ended up going through multiple strokes, one of them eventually rendering her righthand hemiplegic, necessitating her moving into a nursing home, which meant her house and assets had to be sold.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Mum and I then moved in with her aunt (my great-aunt), who needed someone there due to her PArkinsons getting to the point where she had very limited mobility.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Then right after, said “do you think I made you feel like that ever?” Then got noticeably nervous.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Which makes me think of one memory that sticks out as a child (I don’t have too many childhood memories, but I remember this one well).",0
survivorsofabuse,"I was probably 3 or 4, and wearing purple underwear, and I’m pretty sure I fell asleep with pyjamas on, and then in the morning I woke up asking why I didn’t have pyjamas on anymore, and my dad and uncle said “you don’t remember?",0
survivorsofabuse,"We came in when you were in bed last night and uncle _______ held you for a bit” and I remember being super confused because I didn’t remember that, and also, why would they come in and hold me when I was asleep?",0
survivorsofabuse,"Anyway, that memory was weird.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Once I committed mentally to therapy and knew I could pay for it, and that if me and the therapist didn't click that I would keep trying until someone did, the anxiety just got better, in the weeks leading up to therapy.",0
survivorsofabuse,"Once I started and she was so unusually good, I have mentioned it on here before but she really is unusually good, it cemented it.",0
survivorsofabuse,The depression has only been more or less gone six weeks or two months.,0
