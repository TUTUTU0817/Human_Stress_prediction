anxiety,It wasn't until I had had countless tests done that came back clean..and went to the ER one last time in desperation to figure out what was wrong that the doc sent me to the pysch as he suspected depression and anxiety (I had lost 10lbs by then..and didn't weigh much to begin with).,1
anxiety,I was diagnosed with moderate-severe clinical depression and anxiety..the pysch ruled out CFS and lyme etc since my symptoms would come and go and kept changing by the day.,1
anxiety,Was prescribed ssri meds..but this gave me the worst panic attack I have experienced in my life..aaand another ambulance ride..,1
anxiety,(I suffer from Major Depression/Anxiety/Fibromyalgia and I wrote this as an example of what I feel on an average day so that people who don't have mental illness can understand) Hollowed out doesn't quite cover the feeling.,1

anxiety,Friends and loved ones (who don't have anxiety) keep telling me to relax and since it's such a busy place it's nothing personal and to not think it worry about it.,0

anxiety,I start my next shift in 30 minutes and stating to freak out and have small panic attacks which haven't happened in a while.,1

anxiety,"I started learning how to drive 4 years ago, and it was okay until I got this driving instructor.",0

anxiety,"But it’s still bad enough that I can’t do much for myself, and I just don’t understand why they can’t believe that.",1
anxiety,I think they must see me as a burden or something because it seems like they don’t think I’m worth helping if my problem stems from anxiety rather than a different(“real”) illness.,1

anxiety,"Instead of saying yeah I have it to or yeah we all get like that, she asked me further questions.",0
anxiety,I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep.,1
anxiety,I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didnʻt want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldnʻt want to compare my stress to that.,0

anxiety,I joined it ultimately because I thought it would make me feel more connected to people.,0
anxiety,"It kind of does, which I'm okay with.",0

anxiety,"Air coming in almost feels like it has viscosity to it, like molasses, which makes me cough.",1
anxiety,"Most of the time, I don't cough up anything so it's dry.",1
anxiety,"This even negatively impacts me more because it causes me relationship anxiety, every time I have a freak out about travelling I start getting intrusive thoughts like ""what if I get there and realize I don't love him or I'm not attracted to him"" or when he sends me a text that makes me happy my anxiety creeps in saying that I'm secretly forcing any positive feelings I have for him.",1
anxiety,I know these are linked to my travel anxiety because they only pop up AFTER I've had a moment of freaking out thinking about the travel.,1
anxiety,"Whenever we Skype, just talking to him feels like home, and talking about the upcoming trip feels just exciting, not nerve-wracking.",0
anxiety,"This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it.",1

anxiety,I just told them I had too much anxiety and breaking up with my boyfriend made me really depressed.,1
anxiety,"And that I didn't know what I'm going to do, maybe I'll find a job.",0
anxiety,So now I just stay home and go on my computer all day.,1
anxiety,I leave the house maybe twice a week.,0
anxiety,I have constant feelings about being useless and that I'd be better off dead.,1
anxiety,"So earlier today I was suffering from extreme derealization, depression, and anxiety.",1
anxiety,So what I did is I let the thoughts free and whenever I got a tnhoguht I ignored it and I think I just suppressed my anxiety deep down.,1
anxiety,Now instead of having a panic attack I'm having body symptoms of it.,1
anxiety,I can't think myself form the symptoms.,1
anxiety,I can't find the trigger it just happened.,1

anxiety,"We were such good friends once, but I have to admit we hadn't talked about art or writing (the things that made us friends) for years.",0
anxiety,"My anxiety has muddied the waters, and maybe all my shit and all my emotional abuse crap did ruin everything and it was all my fault.",1
anxiety,Maybe I did end things because I'd felt blamed for 2 months straight and just wanted to get away from the anxiety it was all causing me.,1
anxiety,"Maybe I should have been the one to grovel, because I'd fucked up so bad over the situation.",1
anxiety,I didn’t sleep that night and eventually was fine.,1

anxiety,Now I'm absolutely paranoid that they'll find out or they hate me now or I'll get fired for this.,1
anxiety,I'm so paranoid I'm worried they'll see me or come to my house to check on me even though I know they would never do that.,1
anxiety,I just wish someone could understand or sympathize/empathize with me for once.,0
anxiety,"I suffered a concussion a month ago and I noticed it really has provoked my anxiety to be scared about getting worse and it has even led to me getting depressed and thinking of harming myself I have been like this before, I have had anxiety but not to this level.",1

anxiety,If I’m going to have to live like this forever sometimes I wish I wouldn’t wake up.,1
anxiety,"My anxiety caused me to become independent and cold towards him, but inside I was screaming.",1
anxiety,All I wanted was for him to hold me and tell me everything was fine.,1
anxiety,But my anxiety got the best of us and caused a rift.,1
anxiety,We broke up for a week and then when we got back together we were really good for maybe a month or two and the same insecurities slipped in.,0
anxiety,"Mind you, he has NEVER cheated or even acted interested in other girls.",0
anxiety,Every morning I wake up and it's there on the exact same spot.,0
anxiety,This has been happening for the past 4 days and I thought I need to reach out to someone if they can help me at all?,0
anxiety,"I have convinced myself I have a brain tumour, I keep feeling dissociated and completely out of it I keep touching the same spot on my head like every 20 seconds like a compulsion and it's really getting me down.",1
anxiety,When I swallow i feel as if i can feel a pulling sensation near the spot where this is happening.,0

anxiety,"I want to have a good weekend but it feels impossible now, and I want everyone there to have a good weekend and I don’t want to make it bad.",0
anxiety,I don’t know what to do.,1
anxiety,So I just feel like crawling into my little isolation hole and being sad by myself while knowing that everyone hates me... to be honest I don’t know why I’m overthinking it cause honestly no one would care if I did isolate myself.,1
anxiety,"It’s just I want to be better, not just for other people but for myself too.",0
anxiety,"In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply.",0
anxiety,"Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything.""",0
anxiety,"At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice).",1
anxiety,Again understandable.,0
anxiety,"I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",0
anxiety,"Not a huge amount of weight, but it was a big deal for me.",0

anxiety,"Rarely, I forget about the symptoms.",0
anxiety,"Rarely, they don't bother me, but they still are occurring always.",0
anxiety,I have seen two different doctors about this.,0
anxiety,They ruled out a few things and suggested that it was purely anxiety and that I go on an SSRI.,0
anxiety,"I have not gone on an SSRI yet, however I am planning to do so ASAP.",0
anxiety,So I'm currently in a decision if I suffer from social anxiety or not.,0
anxiety,If I can I will ask ny step mom tonight as we like to watch TV at night diwn stairs with a cuo of tea but thats if she doesn't go to bed straight away.,0

anxiety,"In the past Ive had 3 major ""panic attacks(?)""",1
anxiety,where my whole body is in pins and needles and I canʻt breathe well but they were all triggered by major emotional events.,1
anxiety,I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep.,1
anxiety,I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didnʻt want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldnʻt want to compare my stress to that.,0
anxiety,"""What is nothing is real?",0
anxiety,"What if everything is a figment of your imagination?""",0
anxiety,"I panicked, and grabbed the couch, but the voice inside me said ""It doesn't matter if you grab the couch, what is the couch isn't real?",1
anxiety,"What if your house isn't real?""",0
anxiety,"At this time I called my brother, sobbing, and told him to get my mom.",1
anxiety,"I keep alternating between crying, laughing, and freaking out.",1
anxiety,I'm also really upset right now and my boyfriend isn't making me feel better.,1
anxiety,"He keeps saying things like, this is all your fault and no one is making you think these things.",1
anxiety,And to be patient with things....,0
anxiety,I feel like this is going to kill me?,1
anxiety,My heart is palpitating because I finally responded in a group chat that I'm not so active in because I'm scared nobody is going to care what I say.,1
anxiety,So I finally responded this morning because the chat seems active and it couldn't possibly hurt right?,0
anxiety,I'm trying to beat my anxiety.,0
anxiety,"Well, my fears were confirmed.",0
anxiety,Nobody responded to what I texted.,0
anxiety,I always feel like no one actually likes me and they just put up with me out of pity.,1
anxiety,"It’s a vicious cycle, because that insecurity makes me more self-conscious and standoffish, which makes me more unlikeable.",1
anxiety,I just feel like I’m nothing but a drain on everyone and an inconvenience.,1
anxiety,"I’m constantly plagued by these thoughts about what a terrible person and I am, and it’s just so exhausting.",1
anxiety,I wish I was normal.,0
anxiety,"I am already accountable to my family, boyfriend, pets, co workers, etc and now I have to be accountable to these ppl I couldn’t give two shits about and they are counting on me and I hate the pressure so much.",1

anxiety,UGH.,0
anxiety,I check on my mom several times a day and I KNOW it has to be annoying.,1
anxiety,"I am trying to find the right medication but none seem to work for me, I go to therapy, and I talk about it — but I am so sick of feeling this way.",1
anxiety,"I know it is temporary and that I won’t be this way forever, but right now, it sucks.",1
anxiety,"I can’t sleep because I worry so much, it’s hard to focus at work because I worry so much, it’s hard to be social because I worry so much.",1
anxiety,Thanks for listening.,0
anxiety,"I had the depo shot for the first time at the beginning of March, decided to not go back for the 2nd because I wasn't a fan.",0

anxiety,It's like my brain is bound and determined to make me suffer.,1
anxiety,"University makes my anxiety really bad, I'm too scared to ever ask professors for help which makes my grades worse, and I can't make any friends.",1
anxiety,"All this makes my depression worse, so I end up lying in bed all the time because I'm either too depressed to go to class or having a panic attack.",1
