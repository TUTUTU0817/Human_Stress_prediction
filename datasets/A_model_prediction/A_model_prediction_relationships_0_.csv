relationships,(No mention has ever been made by them how much our daughter is having to miss out on by having this medical issue let alone what their own son is being put through from their lack of respect.),1
relationships,"The other problem is, I genuinely believe Brian's father wants a relationship with our daughter.",0

relationships,tl;dr We broke up.,0
relationships,"If dude is so in love with his solitude he can have it, if he's so worried about resentment and arguments he doesn't have to worry about those either.",0

relationships,"I am a very pragmatic person, but also very independent.",0
relationships,"They're all things I enjoy doing and don't see as being that big of a deal, but she seems to perceive them as grand gestures.",0
relationships,"She regularly says that she ""doesn't deserve"" someone as ""perfect"" as me (which yes, she does, she's amazing, and also I'm not even that great, just moderately thoughtful) and has also said that ""because of past experiences, I have trouble liking people who I know like me...",0
relationships,"I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've ""earned"" the validation.""",0
relationships,"In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her).",0
relationships,"All of this makes me ambivalent about broaching the topic of a committed relationship with her because I don't know how she'll react, but at this point we've both admitted we're falling for each other.",0

relationships,"Jay, Marie, me and the husband were at another couples house.",0
relationships,We were drinking and playing board games but Jay had to work the next day so he stopped early.,0
relationships,Marie starts taking this personally for some reason and then says to all of us that he’s “always ruining her nights out”.,1
relationships,I’d like to be married before we are pregnant.,0
relationships,I’m not willing to compromise on that.,0
relationships,Anyone been in a similar situation?,0
relationships,Advice on how to proceed?,0
relationships,---,0
relationships,I'll try to keep this short and succint so it's easier to read.,0
relationships,I had a very brief relationship with this girl.,0
relationships,We both conected inmediately and tried to be in a relationship.,0
relationships,We both had problems that consumed us: she was bulimic and I had erections issues; we both had parent issues and a nihilistic aproach to life.,0
relationships,"I wasn't a (mentally) strong boy, I was very immature and naive, I suppose she was kind of the same.",0
relationships,"Picked music up again and I'm considering the possibility of doing it for the rest of my life rather than science, which is what I've been led by my environment to believe is my ""destiny.""",0

relationships,I just want to forget.,0
relationships,Is this horribly written?,0
relationships,I think so.,0
relationships,It’s like hes expecting my tummy is spilling over my jeans like a muffin(it’s not) I’m still a size small instead of an Xsmall like I used to be when 14 but that’s pretty fucking normal I reckon.its like god help me if I’m a medium right?,0
relationships,"Today I lashed out at him by saying omg dad it’s cuz I’m wearing these pants today ( the pants which are wide, loos high waisted and make ass look bigger), instead of skinny jeans so I obv gained like 10 pounds or tonnes of kilos or whatever overnight.",0
relationships,Later on he said “it’s so easy to make you mad you shouldn’t react that way just cus you don’t think you’re fat”  this made me think that he is doing this to get a rise out of me which isn’t cool for 55 yo dad or you know an adult.,1
relationships,"Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle, it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me, he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore.",0
relationships,Anyway this part isn’t relevant to my relationship but I’d like to share anyway.,0
relationships,Clearly what i need to do is just talk to her about it.,0
relationships,I have a couple of examples in mind that will drive the point home.,0
relationships,Mainly the first night i was introduced to everyone and a house warming we went to.,0
relationships,We're having dinner tomorrow night.,0
relationships,Thanks a ton for the feedback everyone.,0
relationships,Also deflects my attempts at flirting.,0

relationships,"It's been five years and I'm still having this problem, what do I do?",0
relationships,"I have always told her that if there’s anything she wants to know, no matter how uncomfortable it may be, that I’d tell her I the truth and in return that she would do the same.",0
relationships,I repeatedly gave warning that I didn’t think it would help and that it was a bad idea.,0
relationships,She said she had to know and I told her that I would but she couldn’t turn it into an issue because this all happened before I even knew her.,0
relationships,She agreed.,0
relationships,"I understand people saying that I should’ve given her space when she asked for it, but I am sorry, that is bullshit.",1
relationships,"This week, we stayed in the same house and I slept with her.",0
relationships,We were watching a movie when she went to go to sleep in the next room (she's very tired a lot).,0
relationships,"About an hour later, I heard her crying uncontrollably and shaking and screaming.",0
relationships,It was really hard to see.,0
relationships,"I held her until she went back to sleep, and then stayed with her.",0
relationships,We broke up a month ago because the distance made us miserable.,0
relationships,"We had only been doing long distance for 3-ish months, which is not long at all, but we had been dating before that for roughly 3 years, with a short break in between.",0
relationships,I'm taking a gap year so I've been bouncing from place to place & my parents are so protective that they don't let me visit friends at college often (especially not her since they are suspicious of our relationship anyway [homophobia lol]).,0
relationships,"I did visit her once, but only for a few days and she visited me in return.",0

relationships,I agree and tell her they often forget what they don't care about.,0
relationships,"She doesn't agree, we talk about it.",0
relationships,She feels I am being very black and white in my thinking.,0
relationships,The gist of the comments received was the K isn't going to change and I should get B to go to counselling to help her with her self-esteem and give her some outside input.,0
relationships,"Of course, now K is having an online ""role playing relationship"" with some lady on Grand Theft Auto RP.",0
relationships,B is helping him court her.,0
relationships,She is presenting it as she is okay with this.,0
relationships,"Listen, I've known B since high school, I've known her longer then my brother.",0
relationships,Haven't felt this excited about someone since my ex from over five months ago.,0
relationships,"This guy, J, and I met on Bumble.",0
relationships,"I haven't even met him yet, but we have spent hours chatting on the phone and laughing.",0
relationships,It all feels really effortless.,0
relationships,I've dated a lot since the break up and no one has clicked with me like he has.,0

relationships,"So, I broke up with my boyfriend of over a year early last month, and it's been... rough.",0
relationships,"Half the time, I don't even know why we broke up.",0
relationships,"When people ask me about it, I get so confused as to what to say, because I feel like even *I* don't know.",0
relationships,I thought our breakup was mutual.,0
relationships,"She told me she was excited, I was just more enthusiastic about it.",0
relationships,"I let it go, and we went out with friends for new years.",0
relationships,I still felt this distance.,0
relationships,"New years morning we woke up, I rolled over and told her that I wanted 2018 to be the year we really focus on us, that I was excited to keep working on getting us to a good place.",0
relationships,She didn't seem to care.,0
relationships,So here’s he thing.,0
relationships,I do have feelings for him.,0
relationships,They just aren’t the intensity level I’m used to feeling when I fall for some one.,0
relationships,I normally have this sense of urgency.,0
relationships,Its this “Crazy about you/can’t live with out you” type feeling.,0
relationships,"(felt kinda awkward, but they know i dont want her any harm, but have to protect myself now) I still feel like crap for ending it right before her surgery.",1
relationships,"When she got angry she also insults me for that, that she can never forgive me that ive done this at this time.",1
relationships,2 minutes later she apoligizes for saying that.,0
relationships,Shes really struggeling.,0
relationships,"She also said that we may not be sexually compatible, and that its unfair on me if I stay with her and put up with it.",1
relationships,I obviously told her I don't want to break up and she doesn't either.,0
relationships,I offered her time alone and she was so unsure in herself that she didn't even know if she wanted to take me up on the offer.,0
relationships,"I said that I think we should wait until your appointment in March to freeze your ectropion, to see if that improves your libido.",0
relationships,We ended up crying and cuddling each other.,0
relationships,We had a lot in common and I really liked her.,0
relationships,Then I went back to my country for Christmas holidays and I got to see her.,0
relationships,It was really amazing and honestly it was way better than we expected.,0
relationships,"Anyway, she has good grades and she's going to apply to the US (probably the same university as mine or same city).",0
relationships,But the problem is she will be there in fall 2019.,0
relationships,"I'm 35,husband 37 I always thought it would be ideal to have two kids.. My husband was on board with the idea hypothetically but now that it's actually the time to execute he is totally opposed to the idea His reasons are 1) He feels we can't afford it...He earns pretty well but I don't at the time.",0
relationships,So we won't be able to actually build up a major college fund for her---- I feel that she can always take a loan later but she really can't loan a sibling.,0

relationships,Need to make a move now or never Update: I texted her more about it and she forgot about what happened until I reminded her!,0
relationships,"She said It’s not off the table, she just felt braver yesterday due to the liquid courage.",0
relationships,"So I just asked if she wants to hang one last time, maybe go somewhere like we did last time and have a drink and listen to music.",0
relationships,And if something happens or doesn’t happen it doesn’t matter.,0

relationships,I’m totally open to him being part of the child’s life if he wants.,0
relationships,I know he would be a good dad despite him turning out to be a terrible husband Thanks for the advice guys.,0
relationships,"At times, he would get stalker-ish, and she would remove him from her contacts.",0
relationships,"This would infuriate him, and he would create an alternate character to threaten her, saying how he is going to find her, kill her, and tell me about their relationship.",0
relationships,"Being scared, my wife would add him back, pretend to be friends, only to repeat this cycle over several times over the next few years.",0
relationships,"Yes, they somehow remained ""friends"" for years after this affair.",0
relationships,The next stab came when I was sent to an Air Force base for a 3 month training for my job.,0

relationships,The way she orders food and drinks kinda makes me change my eating and drinking habits when I'm with her.,0
relationships,It's like I'm binging too.,0
relationships,She always excuses herself to the bathroom right after a meal and I know she's purging.,0
relationships,"The more recent time I hung out with her, I put my foot down a little more and told her i didn't want to pay for so much food, and that I wasn't doing shots (I never do shots, but she always orders them for me when I'm out with her and then is really manipulative in order to pressure me to do them).",0
relationships,Everything was absolutely perfect.,0
relationships,"He is always very quiet, but is a complete sweetheart, and very warm and kind once he trusts someone.",0
relationships,He’s pretty much the spitting image of what I imagined of the person I would marry when I was young.,0
relationships,The one thing about him that would have seemed “off” is that he never really talked at all about his life before the Army.,0
relationships,"I know what city he is from, and a couple inconsequential details, but nothing significant.",0
relationships,My sister lives with her BF and my 2 year old nephew about 30 minutes away from me.,0
relationships,A few days ago she asked if her and my nephew can come spend next Monday - Friday with me because her BF is going out of town and she doesn't want to be in the house alone without him (they live with his family so I guess sometimes it gets uncomfortable).,0
relationships,I said okay sure.,0
relationships,I live in 500 sqft a studio but I have a pullout couch in addition to my bed.,0
relationships,I've been with my BF for 3 years and about 5 months ago he unofficially moved in with me (unofficial because we share bills and all of his stuff is here but his mail and whatnot still goes to his parents where he was living before).,0
relationships,He doesnt seem bothered about calling me or meeting me unless I initiate.,0
relationships,"We dont talk for very long as he still lives with his parents and is apparently always ""busy"" helping his mum.",0
relationships,"Im mostly available, as I work part time as Im a student but I live in a rented shared flat.",0
relationships,We seldom talk about the future.,0
relationships,"I want to talk about the future, I planned to work abroad this year as I graduate soon but stopped those plans after meeting him as he is only in college and will take another 3 years until he finishes education.",0
relationships,Which now leads me to where I am now.,0
relationships,I had a talk with person A and she wants to get back together.,0
relationships,Person B really wants a relationship with me.,0
relationships,I don’t want to be a douche bag and cut things off with person b and then go back after my ex and have to deal with all the drama in between that.,1
relationships,But I don’t really want my ex(person a) to go back and try to get into relationships and talk to all these guys.,1
relationships,"I’ve been in the mood since Friday night, we had a date and when we got tired and I let her go to sleep.",0
relationships,Saturday morning I tried doing some forplay and she stopped me and told me to wait till later that night and she would make it up to me.,0
relationships,Saturday night rolls around and she just falls asleep.,0
relationships,"Sunday morning I climb out of bed and start breakfast, and she said “Too bad you were asleep this morning, I tried to wake you up for something special...” Later that day we were getting ready for a birthday party, and she said, “I wish we could be undressing instead, but we got a party to go to...” I took that as a hint that later tonight she’ll finally be in the mood.",0
relationships,"If she were honest or apologetic, I could try to understand.",0
relationships,But is that naive?,0
relationships,I’m just confused.,0
relationships,"I’ve tried to give it time, but I understand less and less.",0
relationships,"I signed up for Facebook over the weekend, and Corrine was in my suggested people to add.",0
relationships,Sorry this is so long!,0
relationships,Thanks in advance if you manage to read it :) My best friend Grace and I met when we were 10 and became best friends almost immediately.,0
relationships,"She was always the ""leader"" in our friendship ever since we were young.",0
relationships,"I didn't mind it, I actually kind of liked it since I was a very shy kid who had no confidence anyway.",0
relationships,It's been a while so I thought those feelings were long gone.,0
relationships,"At one point, I asked if Lily would come talk to me in my room, which she agreed to.",0
relationships,"In there, we made out.",0
relationships,"I don't remember a ton, but I do remember pulling away and immediately telling Lily ""oh my god, I can't believe I just did this.""",0
relationships,"Like a drunk idiot, I called my boyfriend.",1
relationships,"My girlfriend has been under major strain since last year when took a new job, she has been depressed and has mood swings for half a year now.",0
relationships,"She has always been inverted and melancholy, but I feel that the new pressure has pushed it to the verge of disaster.",0
relationships,"I tried to talk to her, but she responded negatively and she had not done anything to help.",0
relationships,In recent months she has said that I am depressed and need help.,0
relationships,She told me that I had a symptom or another when she was actually symptomatic.,0
relationships,etc.,0
relationships,- Bob's father is always begging to let my daughter sleep in his bed.,0
relationships,He takes opioids to sleep and once nearly died because his stove spilled smoke into the room and he didn't wake up.,0
relationships,Bob sees no problem with allowing this.,0
relationships,- Bob has been visiting prositutes since he left and doesn't use protection.,0
relationships,"I want to sit down and have a talk with my GF, but I don't want to roll in unprepared.",0
relationships,Should I even be attempting to have this talk?,1
relationships,"If so, are there any books or reading materials I can go over to help back my case up?",0
relationships,---   **tl;dr**: Looking for ways to talk to my GF about her daughters spoiled behavior.,0
relationships,But I'm not physically attracted to him.,0
relationships,Normally personality does a lot for me.,0
relationships,I've met guys who I didn't feel attracted to and then started to really like because of their personalities (and vice versa).,0
relationships,"I go through days where I skype this guy and like the idea of him and feel like I can be physically attracted to him, but there are other days I don't feel anything physically.",0
relationships,"We are very long distance at the moment, so we've haven't had any face to face in person time for the past month (he's moving in 5 months).",0
relationships,I really need help!,0
relationships,"My boyfriend and I started dating March of 2017, and we had been friends for a couple years before that.",0
relationships,"For the first 7 months of our relationship, we were inseparable.",0
relationships,"We sleep in the same bed almost every night, though we are not moved in together (this comes into play later).",0
relationships,"We made each other very happy, and there was very minimal tension.",0
relationships,"also this week I posted about being excited about going home for the summer and she replied with ""Super stoked for you to come home this summer (Winky Emoji).",0
relationships,I of course reciprocate the compliments etc.,0
relationships,"So, My question is this.",0
relationships,I want to do a little something for her for valentines day.,0
relationships,We have been talking for about a month now.,0
relationships,He says he doesn’t want to go to therapy (I know that’s the usual suggestion) Are there things we can do to work through this slump?,0
relationships,Is it better to make him go out a little each day or is that too much?,0
relationships,I don’t want to make it worse.,0
relationships,Thanks for the help Tl;dr: how can I help my uninterested boyfriend.,0
relationships,I don't know how to mention this to my SO without seeming like Mulder.,1
relationships,EDIT.,0
relationships,Clearly what i need to do is just talk to her about it.,0
relationships,I have a couple of examples in mind that will drive the point home.,0
relationships,Mainly the first night i was introduced to everyone and a house warming we went to.,0
relationships,"We have been together for a little over 2 years now, and high school is nearly over.",0
relationships,He’s been wanting to move to Toronto for a while now and I had considered moving there for university too.,0
relationships,"However, I plan on staying at home (Toronto is only 4 hours away).",0
relationships,I would say things about how awesome it would be if we moved in together or visit each other.,0
relationships,Never once did he mention he did not want a long distance relationship.,0
relationships,"I stopped, looked down, looked at her.",0
relationships,"I took her hand, took a step onto the other side, into the other city.",0
relationships,I turned to face her and took her other hand.,0
relationships,"I looked into her deep eyes and said, “This is the first city we’ve traveled to together, may we travel to many more”.",0
relationships,I pulled her over the city line and kissed her.,0
relationships,I was a little confused at what they meant so her husband decided to meet me and talk to me about what was going on.,0
relationships,"The way that he put it, he was saying that my husband wouldn't get physical from what he could tell, but there are boundaries that he passed.",0
relationships,"Unfortunately, he couldn't provide any examples because he couldn't remember what was said, but he could remember the feeling that he had, and it was disgust.",0
relationships,This was during the holiday season when their company had an influx of new people and they would be gone within a few weeks because the work they do is very physical and not a lot of people can handle it.,0
relationships,"My friends husband told me and quote, ""There's friendship, there's flirting, which he did but its innocent because everyone flirts, but then there's certain boundaries that you don't say to someone else while being in a commited relationship or marriage with someone else and he was doing that.""",0
relationships,"I (A Minor Male) am posting onto this subreddit, because My girlfriend's (A Minor Female) family has gone through a 'break-up' and an unwanted 'reuniting' of sorts.",0
relationships,"We'll call My girlfriend ""Linda"".",0
relationships,"""Linda's"" immediate family consists of Her mother, Her grandmother, and Her sister.",0
relationships,"The most notable interaction that the Father, Bill, had with the family was drunkenly banging on Linda's mother's window *early* in the morning.",0
relationships,Bill walked out for reasons unknown to me about 16 years ago after the birth of Linda .,0
relationships,I would never think of having a talk like that with my ex and not telling my GF.,1
relationships,It seems to be lying by omission in a relationship where we agreed there would be no secrets.,0
relationships,Should I confront her?,1
relationships,Suggestions on how to broach this?,0
relationships,---,0
relationships,Suddenly everyone in the family was doing as she wished to appease her.,0
relationships,FH is her youngest and always around when she has 'flares'.,0
relationships,She has refused medication which made her flares better for fear of the side effects (palpitations).,0
relationships,The flares make her cry and demand death come sooner.,0
relationships,His sister is much less involved and appears to have the same POV I do about his mother's illness.,0
relationships,"When she was an infant, she would play with her when she was told to leave her alone.",0
relationships,She would do things she wasn't supposed to.,0
relationships,She often acted like Grace was her child.,0
relationships,"It didn't help that Anna is mature looking at 5'8"", and was often asked if Grace was her baby.",0
relationships,"Around when Grace was 18 months, I got asked less and less to watch her, and Anna was doing it.",0
relationships,"Hi Everyone, I've been dating my GF for about 10 months, and everything is pretty good with the relationship.",0
relationships,I think the two biggest weaknesses are my clinginess and her sometimes-poor communication skills.,0
relationships,"I like to express how I feel, and I'd much rather talk about the elephant in the room, whereas she likes to sweep things under the rug.",0
relationships,"We met at college, and her girlfriends from school have a group of guy friends.",0
relationships,Both me and him want to keep in contact and still do things together as friends but i find it extremely hard.,0
relationships,"Also i know there is a big age gap, i am 23 and he is 39 but i have connected with him in ways i never connected with anyone else, and both my previous relationships of 3 and 1 year was with guys that were 11 and 13 years older than me, i just like older men and i am more comfortable with them.",0
relationships,Could all this feelings be wrong?,0
relationships,Could it be because i have no one here and i found comfort with him to be the reason i developed feelings for him?,0
relationships,I am not sure and i want your help!,0
relationships,Do you think she's just trying to let me down easy or that there might be something but she's just not ready?,0
relationships,Everybody I work with says she likes me.,0
relationships,Her close friend from work even said something similar.,0
relationships,"I'm probably over thinking this, as I tend to do.",0
relationships,What do yall think?,0
relationships,"Which admittedly, I have been catching some feelings for her.",0
relationships,But I want this to continue since I enjoy her company and we vibe well together.,0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: I met this cool girl that I might have feelings for but she told me she has no current intention to date, so we're really just FWB that hangout.",0
relationships,"For somebody who has never done anything casual and have only had relationships or talked to girl to eventually date them, how do I become comfortable having sex and hanging out with somebody without catching feelings for them?",0
relationships,"During one of our many discussions, she compared it to me playing with people on my friends list.",0
relationships,I explained that usually we are in game friends and only really speak about the game.,0
relationships,A few times she offered to talk about in game stuff only with her friends.,0
relationships,"The last time she offered, I accepted feeling that it would solve my issue.",0
relationships,"Once I accepted her offer, she backpedaled almost immediately during the same conversation.",0
relationships,"Last night, I had a few friends over for New Years', as one does.",0
relationships,"We all got pretty damn drunk, as one does.",0
relationships,"Among my drunk friends was my good friend ""Lily,"" someone who I've been friends with for a while.",0
relationships,"A long time ago, she told me she had romantic feelings for me.",0
relationships,"I turned her down, being in a relationship, but admittedly I had a small crush on her too.",0
relationships,"I didn't have time to text a lot like I used to, and certainly couldn't realistically plan trips to see her anymore.",0
relationships,"She was plainly unhappy with me for not being as communicative anymore, but things really came to a head when I began dating someone.",0
relationships,"Lisa was the only person in my inner circle of friends to have a poor reaction when I told her I was dating another woman, which was shocking to me because I trusted her, and because she often used social media to convey her allyship with the LGBT community.",0
relationships,"She often told me that as soon as I met my gf, I quit talking to her (Lisa).",0
relationships,"As my relationship with my gf became more serious, Lisa and I became even more distant from each other, and she would often ignore my texts or emails (neither of us were ever much for talking on the phone).",0
relationships,"I don't feel at all like he doesn't like me or has gone off me, we meet once a week and 'chat' daily but I'm kind of unhappy I'm not getting the 'cant get enough of talking' experience that usually comes along with being enamoured at the start.",0
relationships,"I nearly always reply within 20 mins if I'm not busy because I'm still in the excited pahse, but I get a lot of 3/4 wait times with a read receipt, with him coming on and off whatsapp within that period before I get a reply.",0
relationships,It hardly screams that he's really into me when he is ok to wait that long to reply.,0
relationships,I assume he's messaging others so why not me?,0
relationships,I'm his new potential gf!,0
relationships,"Our sense of humor is very similar.. She's gorgeous, funny, smart, and likes some of the same things I do.. She's wifey material..",0
relationships,The way she loves on her dogs and cares for them makes me think she'd make a good mom 8-10 yrs from now.,0
relationships,These are some of the biggest reasons I see myself with her.,0
relationships,**tl;dr**: Off-and-on heterosexual relationship since we were in high school.,0
relationships,She met me and cheated on her highschool BF.,0
relationships,"For many years I visited her and asked if she please could do things to mitigate my allergies (keeping the cat out of ONE room-where I slept, not give me clothes to wear that the cat had laid on, vaccuuming) and she did not do anything.",0
relationships,"""The cat almost never wants to be in that room"" I got as a reply, but he was free to roam everywhere.",0
relationships,A few years ago I just stopped going to their home and after taking that control I have felt much less sad about this.,0
relationships,- Since she got together with her new partner I wanted us to go on a short trip (weekend) staying somewhere over night with her.,0

relationships,"Hello all, I am 23 and I'm studying in the US for getting my PhD.",0
relationships,I applied to that country 2 years ago.,0
relationships,I found this girl online (she's a student in the same university I got my bachelor).,0
relationships,She's studying the same major as I do.,0
relationships,"It was wrong, I never told her when it was happening, only after I ended things, because I wanted to be serious with her.",0
relationships,"She took it as cheating and to this day, goes back to it at every argument we have.",0
relationships,2.,0
relationships,"A few months after I told her about the other girl, I found out that she was actually still in a relationship with her ex.",0
relationships,She would visit him when she was in her home town.,0
relationships,I have tried to her encourage her as best as I can.,0
relationships,"The job she had was 10 hours per week, which I got for her to tutor a friend’s 10yr old (who is a challenging child).",0
relationships,"She has an events business with her mother, which operates approximately once every six weeks to host mystery dinners, which is very popular, but does not make much funds.",0
relationships,She spends a large amount of time on this and I get frustrated that some of that effort could be put into finding more stable work.,1
relationships,She studies one unit a semester.,0
relationships,Engagement rings.,0
relationships,I've been thrilled about the thought of being married particularly in the last 2 years.,0
relationships,"To be clear, I have a strong dislike of diamonds and the entire idea of an expensive ring or wedding.",0
relationships,All I wanted is a cute and unique ring below $200 at the most.,0
relationships,I told him all of this and waited... and waited.. and waited.,0
relationships,What's a compassionate way of telling a friend that you can't participate in certain activities with her anymore?,0
relationships,"For the record, I'm seeing Pam again next week.",0
relationships,"She wanted to go out to eat, but i told her I can't afford to.",0
relationships,Instead she'll come over to my place.,0
relationships,I think this would be a good time to talk to her.,0
relationships,I've been trying the online dating thing recently and met a very nice guy.,0
relationships,We've been on 3 dates so far and he's great!,0
relationships,"Funny, nice, understanding.",0
relationships,Unfortunately I don't really feel a spark.,0
relationships,I thought going on more than 1 date would let me see him as more than a friend but I have no desire to even kiss him even though I enjoy hanging out with him.,0
relationships,"So when Markus asked me for a date night, just the two of us, I didn't hesitate.",0
relationships,"I have loved this man so much, I think I still do.",0
relationships,These date nights made us feel like we're young again.,0
relationships,"Everything we used to do back when we were just dumb teenagers, we're doing again now.",0
relationships,I was so happy I could cry.,0
relationships,"Thing is, after we broke up we had sex a few times in August and September and as far as I'm aware she has slept with at least one other guy in this period too.",0
relationships,The real question is what do i do now?,0
relationships,"I want to tell the guy about this, and wish someone would've done the same to me 2 years ago.",0
relationships,"But at the same time I'm one of her exes, is it really my fight to take?",0
relationships,"tl;dr: Ex probably cheated on her new boyfriend with me, should i tell him or just stay out of it?",1
relationships,"B wanted her to come with him to Chile, a place she has always wanted to go, and spend a week or two exploring together.",0
relationships,"In her writing, she seemed genuinely conflicted.",0
relationships,"The next day, B tried to kiss her, but she said ""that she couldn't"".",0
relationships,B said he was falling for her.,0
relationships,He really wanted her to go with her to Chile.,0
relationships,My wife (we've been together 8 years) however is determined to 'finish the job'.,0
relationships,Her father taught her much of what she knows and that is certainly a factor as to why she is an constructual engineer...,0
relationships,But unlike her father she isn't a certified electrician or plumber nor is she especially skilled at carpentry.,0
relationships,"The issue is that we live 5 hours away and even if we did go *every* weekend to work on the house it would take well over a year to even get it into a acceptable state, let alone 'finished' and sellable.",0
relationships,I brought up the idea of getting contractors to finish the house.,0
relationships,"She was unemployed and toyed with the idea of answering ads from strangers to perform fetish tasks for money, to include nudity (but no sex).",0
relationships,It really wrecked me that she would consider that.,0
relationships,She brought it up once again not too long ago (not seriously) and I flipped out.,0
relationships,She was working as a nanny for a long time and I was very insecure about her and her boss because of my fear that she would be willing to do sex work for money.,0
relationships,"Now, she has never done any sex work for money and we agreed that it is not something I am comfortable with and she will not do it, so that's not an issue.",0
relationships,All that.,0
relationships,When we're not together in the evenings we talk through messages.,0
relationships,"The conversations aren't stilted, and there isn't one sidedness, but it's just that there's a lot of it Right now i'm ignoring her for periods of 15 minutes or so, but I feel bad.",0
relationships,"She is that attentive that it makes me tired, I have to write everything in a long single message with line breaks otherwise as soon as I start messaging she starts replying.",0
relationships,I feel like I can be that person for my girlfriend since I love her but I don't think I want to sacrifice my happiness for that.,0
relationships,I just want to have a simple life and find someone who will have time for me.,0
relationships,I didn't grow up in a loving family like her.,0
relationships,It's not always about money.,0
relationships,I grew up comfortably but there is not much love in the family I grew up in so money isn't important to me.,0
relationships,"He became depressed and gained a lot of weight, which makes him even more insecure about his looks.",0
relationships,He also dropped out of university but now has come back to finish his degree.,0
relationships,"About me, I’m 21 years old, already graduated from college and now working a part time job but my goal is to become a flight attendant.",0

relationships,"However, since that hour had passed, her boyfriend refused to stay any longer and made both of them go home, even though she really wanted to go on the boat.",0
relationships,"These are some of the bigger events that have pissed me off; however, they have the same fight everyday regarding their differing values, and her wanting to do things/live her life and him refusing to make any sort of sacrifice or compromise to do that with her, resulting in her just settling to the situation.",1
relationships,"Since graduation, he accepted that crappy job and moved across the country, taking her with him.",0
relationships,"Hey everyone, throwaway for personal reasons.",0

relationships,"I get there and there's a person I've literally never seen before, a guy.",0

relationships,He undertook a massive project to essentially redo the entire house by himself.,0
relationships,At the time of this post it has been 7 years on going and had faced innumerous delays.,0
relationships,"The biggest restrictions was of course money, my father-in-law refused to get any contractors, in the belief they were too expensive and wouldn't do the job to the standard he wanted, he also sourced all the materials from back yard sales and contacts.",0
relationships,My friends are getting kind of weirded out by all of this and I am running out of excuses for my boyfriend.,1

relationships,I feel like I'm going to melt whenever I'm around him.,0
relationships,"Although you're thinking, what's the worst that can happen.",0
relationships,He rejects you?,0
relationships,"Previously, I made a stupid attempt to try and hook up with him during one of my ""breaks"" with my boyfriend (we previously broken up for a few months, but got back together during the 3 years together).",0
relationships,Any suggestions?,0
relationships,I apologize if this is trivial in nature.,0
relationships,Thanks for the help.,0
relationships,"EDIT: I should also mention that when I do fall asleep, I snore REALLY loudly and I can hear myself in my sleep.",0
relationships,My boyfriend says that it sounds like I'm not breathing or trying to breathe.,0
relationships,How do I change the way I'm thinking about this so I can understand I shouldn't be catching feelings despite having sex with her?,1
relationships,"Which admittedly, I have been catching some feelings for her.",0
relationships,But I want this to continue since I enjoy her company and we vibe well together.,0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: I met this cool girl that I might have feelings for but she told me she has no current intention to date, so we're really just FWB that hangout.",0
relationships,"The connection was 100% real and 100% mutual, no way around it and it’s the first time I’ve felt that way about someone in 8 years.",0
relationships,Being around her lit a fire in me again - I wanted to be a better man because of her.,0
relationships,"I was sweet to her but not overly so, her son was with his dad for Christmas and I sent her flowers since I knew she was feeling down.",0
relationships,She called me the next day and was so grateful and loved them.,0
relationships,I was complementary of her and she ate it up and asked me in a non-guilty (more of an “I love how you are to me” way) why I’m so sweet to her.,0
relationships,I work with her sister.,0
relationships,Her sister got me this great job at our firm after I was introduced through a mutual friend and hit it off.,0
relationships,"I'm not unqualified, but her recommendation certainly helped.",0
relationships,I met my ex through her sister.,0
relationships,"Her sister is charming, personable, but also the most vindictive person I've ever seen.",0

relationships,"A few months after starting classes, my buddy told me that Chloe has a  crush on me, and gave me the impression that she wanted me to be aware of this, however, even after that, she didn’t try to talk to me or make herself noticed at all.",0
relationships,"She is a pretty girl, the artsy kind that likes to travel, read poetry and paint, coincidentally the exact opposite of my girlfriend who has very different hobbies.",0
relationships,"Like I said, I love Alice and I didn’t think much of it.",0
relationships,Her avoidant behaviour hasn’t changed and I didn’t approach her either.,0
relationships,---   **tl;dr**: met a friend of a friend at a party.,0
relationships,"over the past couple days, he's been msging my girlfriend about random shit but isn't actually being too creepy.",0
relationships,"She no longer wants to talk to him and ignores his messages, but he keeps messaging anyway.",0
relationships,"She wants him to stop while minimizing drama/confrontation, but I'm not sure if it's possible.",1
relationships,Total time apart was maybe 24 hours.,0
relationships,"Second time, he first asked for a ""break,"" then, unsurprisingly, ended if for good.",0
relationships,"A month or two after that we met up again, he said he wanted to get back together, then the next time told me it would never happen.",0

relationships,"Her parents have 2 big houses, I live in a 1 room small apartment.",0
relationships,"One of her brothers lived in the 2nd house of her parents and left last year so we where fixing it (it was a completely mess, we had to spend a LOT of money to make it habitable.",0
relationships,We were planing to move before Christmas but I put all on hold for her thesis so she could focus on that.,0
relationships,She said plenty of times that my apartment was a big issue for her because it was so small and that when we moved to her parent's 2nd house we would have a great improvement in our relationship and our life.,0
relationships,"And enjoy this day of the miracle that is being above-ground, breathing the air, and feeling the world around you.",0
relationships,"If anything like this has happened (or is happening) to you, know that there's at least one guy out there who can relate.",0

relationships,---,0
relationships,However 4 months ago I moved to a different country for education.,0
relationships,"We met a handful number of times before I left and they weren’t dates exactly, just as best friends.",0

relationships,We recently started dropping hints to each other that we like each other and finally decided to discuss what we feel.,0
relationships,She told me she loves me and wants a relationship.,0
relationships,I have to first start off by saying my voice is not high-pitched.,0
relationships,"My inflection occasionally goes up, especially if I'm excited about something.",0
relationships,"I'm sort of expressive with my hands while talking, though I don't think more than anyone else, male or female.",0
relationships,She tells me this is the only thing that is making her doubt our relationship.,0
relationships,A little background: this has been an issue with her for her last several boyfriends.,0
relationships,(I really did).,0
relationships,"If she needed space to do homework, thats perfectly fine.",0
relationships,I did my best to assuage her anxiety.,0
relationships,"So we'd postpone another week, another day... only, either the night before or the morning of, she'd cancel me visiting again... again.. and again... That put a little strain on our relationship, we wanted to see each other.",0
relationships,"I have no problem with a few years either way, hell the last girl I dated was 6 years younger, but this is an entire decade.",0
relationships,That's a lot.,0
relationships,But other than the number itself I don't know if I should care this much or not.,0
relationships,She's pretty mature for her age and I'm admitedly a bit of a late bloomer so we are in roughly the same stage of life so that's not an issue like in a lot of age differential cases.,0
relationships,But I just can't help shake the thought of how weird it seems to me.,0
relationships,She never really felt the need to do that and occasionally would go out with her friends.,0
relationships,"Everything was great -- I took care of her extremely well, she took care of me patiently and amazingly.",0
relationships,"I bought her a car, paid for her rent, and ultimately supported her so she could focus and finish her college (I'm full time employed, the breadwinner in the relationship).",0
relationships,Our relationship was VIVID and full of color in the beginning.,0
relationships,"We had our own apartment, got a beautiful dog together, and traveled to a few places.",0
relationships,"Many of my cohorts asked me ""how are you two even friends?""",0
relationships,when he came to which I couldn't give a clear answer.,0
relationships,"So in short, we have a business license and agreement we both signed.",0
relationships,"We were friends, but I think time has changed him and I and I don't think we would be friends if we met today.",0
relationships,"He isn't productive for the business and his practices many times seems to include emotion and his own self interests rather than the business, so I find him unfit as a business partner as well.",0
relationships,She works 6 days a week and usually ends her work day around 9-10pm.,0
relationships,I work from 9-5pm.,0
relationships,"She lives across the city, 45 minutes away from me.",0
relationships,"When she works, we can hardly meet.",0
relationships,"So when we do make plans to meet, I extremely value those time.",0
relationships,I realized that maybe it's better if we break up even though I love him so much and he's one of the most important people in my life.,0
relationships,It's already hard enough to decide to break up with someone you love and it's even harder when you can't do It because the person won't show up.,1
relationships,"If we werent together for so long, I'd probably would've just blocked him already and carry on.",0
relationships,But I don't want that.,0
relationships,I want to keep being friends.,0
relationships,**Tl;dr: Thinking my 2 friends who broke-up are soulmates but may be both heading for a second-best option.,0
relationships,"** Very long post, please read only if you are interested in complicated realtionships and take it maybe as a short novel.",0
relationships,"I have 2 friends who got together when 19, they were inseparable, instant soulmates, I know they imagined their whole life together almost immediately, never even thinking they can break-up.",0
relationships,"For 10 years, they were the best couple I know, not fighting, respecting each other greatly and having a ""higher"" connection.",0
relationships,"Hey, I (m, 18) don't know, what I should do, about my brother.",0
relationships,"Apart from many different things that are bothering me about him this one is at the moment a big problem, because I often have people here at my house: He doesn't clean the bathroom, which means he doesn't flush the toilet, pees on the ground, leaves sometimes condoms laying around etc.",0
relationships,He doesn't listen to my parents or me.,1
relationships,Sometimes one a week on the weekend.,0
relationships,This worked greated.,0
relationships,Until late june.,0
relationships,She started to cancel my visits to see her.,0
relationships,"Asking if I was mad, when I constantly told her I supported everything she needed to do to succeed.",0
relationships,I tried to reply to most but I think I'd like to forget about this post for a bit and move on.,0
relationships,So I'm going to stop replying.,0
relationships,"If there is advice or information that someone hasn't given me yet and you think would be helpful, please feel free to private message me.",0
relationships,I'm planning to go to the wedding.,0
relationships,I will not be going out of my way to help with the wedding.,0
relationships,How do I figure out what is putting these guys off?,1
relationships,Any advice is appreciated!,0
relationships,"TL;DR: Have been on 3 first dates over the last few months, and each I thought went well or above and beyond well, but each of them haven't wanted to go on a second date with me.",0
relationships,What am I doing wrong?,1
relationships,How do I figure out what I'm doing wrong?,1
relationships,IDK.,0
relationships,I've applied to anything I can think of and have had no luck.,0
relationships,"But at least I'm not dealing with all this stress with someone who ""loves"" me not giving a damn if that happens.",1
relationships,"Thank you all for giving me perspective that no, I was not being unreasonable and it wasn't that he decided who lives in his home (which I NEVER disagreed with) but that it was messed up of him to offer, plan, go back on it, and then want to act like that never happened.",1
relationships,"And for the people who implied I have no ""market value"" to him, my divorce was because my ex cheated.",1
relationships,"Plus, we’re using his car, which will eventually result in the usual wear and tear and expenses.",0
relationships,"We equally split all shared expenses like gas, food, rent, and bills, but we both have the same salary and similar assets.",0
relationships,"Do any cohabiting couples pool and split their commuting expenses equally, or do you just chalk it up to a difference in individual expenses and each pay your own way?",0
relationships,tl;dr : My boyfriend's commute is twice as expensive as mine and it doesn't really seem fair.,0
relationships,Should we split it?,0
relationships,"I might sound a bit bridezilla here, but I’m extremely annoyed.",1
relationships,We set our wedding date last August for July 15th.,0
relationships,We specifically picked this date after looking at the average temperatures for that date for the last 5 years.,0
relationships,"We determined the highs were about 7 degrees cooler than the following weekends in July, so we went with the 15th.",0
relationships,"Wouldn’t you know it, but my FMIL booked their family vacation for July.",0
relationships,One night after going to a club we go back to our friends and we snuggle next to each other.,0
relationships,She interlocks her fingers into my hand and later on in the night turns around and kisses me.,0
relationships,We kiss for the whole night.,0
relationships,We couldn't do anything more because our friends were sleeping in the same room.,0
relationships,We didn't talk about that night until a few weeks later when we went to a bar together.,0
relationships,"Since then I´ve met some ""wrong ones""- I mean guys who lied to me, for example this guy who was trying to convince me that he loves me and wants only me and I found out that he´s been dating a girl since 2014 and that they´re expecting a baby.",0
relationships,"So yeah after these few ""mistakes"", I started having trust issues.",0
relationships,"I just couldn´t trust guys, every time I met someone I couldn´t trust him and couldn´t stop expecting something bad coming.",0
relationships,In December last year the best thing in my life happened to me.,0
relationships,"I´ve met a guy, and he´s #EverythingGoals.",0
relationships,So we were talking about it and she wouldn't budge again.,0
relationships,"The conversation started to heat up, nothing I said was enough, that we would buy something, that I would cook with her, that we could go 1 day earlier and cook at my grandma's, nothing.",0
relationships,She pushed me to the edge again until I lost it and ended the argue saying that she mustn't go this year with me.,0
relationships,"That she must stay with her family, that I didn't want her to go with my family so she wouldn't have to worry anymore.",0
relationships,She calmed down and we got to sleep.,0
relationships,"(If so, how do I work on fixing that?)",0
relationships,* Is this a lack of clear communication?,0
relationships,(By either one party or both) * Should I try to get back in touch with them?,0
relationships,Thank you if you made it this far.,0
relationships,"It’s resulted in me coming up with excuses to not hang out with him, which, yes, I feel bad about.",1
relationships,"Through my interactions with him, I have gotten the hint that Jack is interested in me, in a more-than-friends kind of way.",0
relationships,I don't want to assume this as a fact—it's certainly possible that he is just trying to make a new friend.,0
relationships,"Along with many small hints that he *is* interested in me, however, the biggest hint is probably whenever I mention my boyfriend.",0
relationships,"I have a boyfriend of about a year, and whenever I do mention him, Jack seems very visibly uncomfortable.",0
relationships,Good goals - She finished undergrad and already wants to go back to school.,0
relationships,I value girls who want to get a good education or pursue entrepreneurship.,0
relationships,"Doesn't ask me for much - Given my financial situation, she hasn't asked me to do something that was out of my budget.",0
relationships,"Since I'm not really feeling her, should I let her go?",0
relationships,I'm asking this because most of the girls I've met aren't like her.,0
relationships,I will not be sharing my credit details.,0
relationships,"Though hard, I will end my friendship with her.",0
relationships,Might think about it if she apologizes but am not sure at this moment.,0
relationships,I will cherish connections with more on my other friends who were super nice to let me know what's happening at home.,0
relationships,"It's really frustrating not being able to confront Jenna physically but as others mentioned, I hope others who've initially believed her will realize the truth.",1
relationships,"So the now: we had been commiserating for a while about our shitty exes and stress, and about 3 weeks ago I was on a date and realized I would have rather just spent the night with her instead of the date.",0
relationships,A couple days later while having some drinks and de-stressing I kissed her.,0
relationships,She kissed me back.,0
relationships,"We stopped before having sex and ended up meeting a couple days later where we both agreed to take things slow, in light of our most recent breakups.",0
relationships,We ended up spending the next few nights together as she didn't want to be home around her ex and we just cuddled and would kiss but then stop before we had sex.,0
relationships,And we end up spending an indefinitely long period of time together that just never seems like it will end.,0
relationships,"I would really like to be able to hang out with her, like cook dinner, or go to a bar, or watch a movie, for example, and then just both go back to our individual homes and do our own thing.",0
relationships,"But, that seems impossible.",0
relationships,"I guess I’m really if it is necessary to constantly, physically, be with a S/O for a healthy relatioship to flourish?",0
relationships,Am I being unreasonable/ inconsiderate in my desire to be alone?,1
relationships,"I was home for winter break, and I didn't see him at all during that time.",0
relationships,"My issue revolves around me feeling insanely guilty anytime I'm out with him, anytime he buys me things, etc.",1
relationships,"It's like, I hear my mother's voice in my head and she's yelling at me for making bad choices, telling me I shouldn't be wasting my time with a loser like him, that I'm a lowlife, etc etc.",1
relationships,"To clarify, I'm a goodie-two-shoes.",0
relationships,"I never did anything ""bad"" until I was in my early teens.",0
relationships,Be ready to contribute (reasonably).,0
relationships,"B - Calmly, with neutral to negative vocabulary and intonation express dissatisfaction with certain behavior, action or outcome of action and politely ask not to repeat same behavior/action/make sure particular outcome doesn’t repeat again.",0
relationships,Make sure message was audible and comprehended and if necessary still calmly repeat again Be ready for calm reasonable discussion in case of decline.,0
relationships,"C - Harsh, sudden, loud expression of dissatisfaction.",0
relationships,It's heartbreaking to watch him get up at night to cry.,1
relationships,I suggested therapy but he's not in favour of it.,0
relationships,"I think his father passing has also altered his reactions, which are out of whack now.",0
relationships,"I was sick last week and was not in town - he let a couple of dishes fester in the sink, and I discovered when I got back that there was fungus on it.",0
relationships,(i.e.,0
relationships,"When I'm single it's never an issue if a person I'm seeing is sleeping with others but as soon as I fall in love, I can get kind of possessive.",0
relationships,My partner is very much the opposite.,0
relationships,All of his relationships have been open and he's slept with pretty much all of his friends.,0
relationships,Maybe a few months ago he told me that he'd really like it if I slept with other people.,0
relationships,I was fairly keen but was getting weird gut fear at the thought of him sleeping with other people.,0
relationships,"We kept in touch the entire time (and he'd always seem to want me desperately, even telling me things like ""I can't wait to see you as soon as I'm back"").",0
relationships,"But when he got back, he didn't see me right away.",0
relationships,"And despite my asking him a couple of times (like, two or three), we didn't see each other for nearly two months.",0
relationships,"Eventually, I literally said ""So are we ever going to see each other again or is this just over?""",0
relationships,"He responded by immediately asking me on a date for that week, at a nice French restaurant near his place.",0
relationships,I could really use additional input on this because I'm not exactly sure what a healthy and compatible relationship looks like at this point.,0
relationships,"When we try to go out and do things, we often do not have fun because our personalities clash.",0
relationships,"Example of this, I wanted to go kayaking and was surprised that he said yes because he rarely wants to be outside.",0
relationships,We get to the springs to kayak and I want to go in the water because I see no point in kayaking if you don't go in the water.,0
relationships,He refuses because he hates water.,0
relationships,"He has struggled to hold jobs, finish his degree, or make rent on a monthly basis.",0
relationships,Joe and Janet live in the big city a few hours away from the small town where they grew up.,0
relationships,They came here for university and stayed.,0
relationships,About half of Joe’s circle of friends is Janet’s friend circle including ex boyfriends and her college peers.,0
relationships,The other half are bar friends.,0
relationships,"And I also know this is not what my grandmother would have wanted (she was very traditional, and having her granddaughters as pallbearers would just be not her style).",0
relationships,"Personally, I have nothing against changing traditions- I just can't do it.",0
relationships,"On top of it, I was not asked if I would be a pallbearer, I just found out via my sister that I would be one.",0
relationships,My Dad was planning on telling me when I got there for the visitation.,0
relationships,Reactions form my family have been:,0
relationships,"However, he seems to have quite few girl-friends and he is friendly with them, but not to this extend I would say.",0
relationships,We have known each other for a month now and I wonder should I wait for him to make a move / should I completely leave it since he is coworker / or should I ask him out?,0
relationships,"I am interested to get to know him and I dont have problem to ask him out casually, however, I dont want to rush things.",0
relationships,"On the other hand, I dont want it to get too old and have lots of small talk and not really get to know each other.",0
relationships,Any advise?,0
relationships,My husband (29m) and I (26f) live across the country from our parents and have been there almost two years now.,0
relationships,"I don't really have a relationship with my inlaws (mf 65ish) (ie they never reach out to me expect for once to ask what to get my husband for his birthday and rarely talk to my husband, they don't ask about me or don't seem interest when I'm brought up) and it doesn't bug me because they are incredibly negative and angry people.",0
relationships,My fil has anger issues and will have a meltdown in public (he's done it several times in front of me) and my mil is self absorbed among several other issues.,1
relationships,"I don't want to get into every story, and man do I have some stories, but i guess it's important to know that I've been warned about their general attitude and behavior from others and everyone who has met them that I'm friends or family with has agreed with me that their son is the source of their happiness and they feed off of each others negativity.",0
relationships,"However, they've never been out rightly malicious towards me.",0
relationships,I got a fair amount of interest on Facebook (though og course a lot of people didn’t follow through) one lady (F 40’s or early 50’s) liked my post and sent a friend request.,0
relationships,I accepted even though I don’t know her because I thought she might be interested in the team.,0
relationships,It turns out she is very well connected in the horse word here and knows a lot of people I know (and seems very popular).,0
relationships,"Well, fast forward to now and this woman has posted all over about her starting an adult drill team.",0
relationships,"Her team is within 20 minutes of where my drill team would be, and so all the people who were interested in mine seem to have gone to hers (I think because she’s a connected horse person here).",0
relationships,I'm dating her for more than one year now and everything seems fine.,0
relationships,"She's loving, she's caring and so am I. I know she truly loves me and I also loves her.",0
relationships,"However, although all of this, some thoughts keep coming at me.",0
relationships,I'll try to focus on these problems below in a objective manner.,0
relationships,**The I want to see other girls problem**.,0
relationships,"Sports teams, mostly, and some TV shows.",0
relationships,He also enjoys a wide range of video games.,0
relationships,"The problem is that I really, truly don't have anything in common with him.",0
relationships,"I don't know shit about sports, I'm not really much of a TV-watcher and I'm not a huge gamer at all.",0
relationships,I have some favorite shows but none of them are really that similar to those that Jack likes.,0
relationships,Two years ago we moved to a different city for his work.,0
relationships,"He earns a lot more than me and his job offers a lot more career progression, so I wanted to support him.",0
relationships,"I’ve always thought we were a good team, there have been times where he’s struggled financially and I’ve helped him out no question.",0
relationships,"We talked about the extra money he’d be able to save by walking to work (2 mins away,) and it seemed as though we were on the same page for what we wanted in the future; buy our own place, a car and start a family.",0
relationships,So I thought all was on the right track.,0
relationships,"They have two children together, Anna and a planned child, Grace.",0
relationships,My uncle has 5 other children with 3 other women.,0
relationships,"Grace is two years old, and I used to watch both Grace and Anna.",0
relationships,"When Grace was born, my family was careful to give Anna more attention.",0
relationships,"Anna is extremely, extremely obsessed with her little sister.",0
relationships,"Then, the issue was that she was too dehydrated for a blood draw and the mental health hospital wouldn't take her without the draw.",0
relationships,"So, I had to take her home and pump her full of water and food and cross our fingers that she could get a draw in the morning.",0
relationships,"By morning, the bed had filled.",0
relationships,"So, the counselor and I took her to the Emergency room to see if they could admit her at the local hospital.",0
relationships,"There, she absolutely *refused* to have her blood drawn and the ER told me that they were just going to have to discharge her if they couldn't get the tests.",0
relationships,"That night wasn’t so great for me as I felt ignored because both of the guys (my bf and the mutual friend) were mostly having conversations with her, leaving me to trail behind.",0
relationships,"I thought maybe it’s because we were “hosting” her and because she’s on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to us - as in, she’s into things and engages in those things we’re not necessarily into, but are interested in and could hold a conversation about.",0
relationships,"Anyway, over the course of our relationship my bf would still bring Sally up occasionally, how they were going to hang out with other coworkers.",0
relationships,"Of course, I’m totally okay with that and I encourage him to be social when he can!",0
relationships,"I’ve met all of his friends and I always enjoy myself around them - except you know who, enter Sally *rolls eyes*.",0
relationships,What should i say?,0
relationships,**tl;dr friend is struggling with alcoholism and bulimia.,0
relationships,She's back in town and wants to hang out and eat and drink.,0
relationships,How do I tell her that I will no longer participate in these activities with Her?,0
relationships,**,0
relationships,I heard from a mutual friend that she got engaged and I’m truly happy for her and would like to wish her congratulations.,0
relationships,I don’t need forgiveness I would just like to move on I guess?,0
relationships,Is it is selfish of me to apologize to her and say congrats or just wish her congrats?,0
relationships,should I just let it go and learn from my immaturity?,1
relationships,Additional info: my sister was also her BFF and after I ghosted her they had a huge dramatic falling out after my sister tried to keep the peace.,0
relationships,"I don't think it would be different in another relationship, and I think both of us accept that we have sexual hangups.",0
relationships,But I always wonder if I would be more sexually passionate in a different relationship.,0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Do men just inherently look at the greener grass, or does a good relationship make you feel settled and satisfied?",0
relationships,"And please don't say ""open relationship"" as the answer...",0
relationships,"OK, so as the title says my sister has been trying to set me up with her friend for a couple of months now.",0
relationships,Up til recently I refused to even entertain the idea because she is slightly over a full decade younger than me.,0
relationships,"My sister thinks I'm being stupid letting the age difference make my mind up for me, to the point where we had a huge fight at Christmas about it but I refused to budge.",1
relationships,"Recently however she's been bringing her friend around a lot (me, my sister, and her husband all get along really well so we hang out at least 2 or 3 weekends a month usually) and as I get to know this girl I am realizing why my sister has been so adamant about it.",0
relationships,It's almost eerie how much we have in common.,0
relationships,Though we both had crushes on each other we weren't sure if the feelings were reciprocated.,0
relationships,"She also has some self esteem issues and told me that she wasn't ready to date someone like me three years ago when we first met, because I was ""too intimidating"", but instead ""settled"" for her ex.",0
relationships,"She dated that ex for two years, but never seemed that interested in him.",0
relationships,She would complain about feeling like a caregiver for him (he was seriously depressed to the point where she had to make doctor appointments for him) and always talked about wanting to be with someone who was more independent and had their life together.,0
relationships,"As her friend I remember her saying she felt like he was good for her at the moment, but that she knew it wouldn't last forever (side note: she was open about her feelings with him, and he agreed to just enjoy things in the moment, though I'm sure he was secretly hopeful she would change her mind).",0
relationships,I'm going to keep this story short.,0
relationships,"I'm (16M) openly gay, he (16M) isn't.",0
relationships,We've been friends and somewhat more for 5 months.,0
relationships,"He hates affection and being touched, but he constantly flirts with me, touches me, wants me to massage his ""sore"" back, wants me to sleep beside him, he cuddles me in his ""sleep""(which he has now revealed to be a fake slumber), and he always asks me about being gay and he truly is trying to understand it.",0
relationships,"Even if anything really happened between us, I wouldn't be getting a fulfilling relationship.",0
relationships,"Back to my dad, during lunch he wanted to say some words to my GF, to encourage her to keep studying the doctorate, he said that if she felt that money was an issue, that don't let her that take her down, that doctorates in our country earn very poorly but that getting that degree would open doors to work abroad and land a job she would love.",0
relationships,"You see, my dad didn't know (well, I've told him plenty of times, but I figured he forgot at the time) that my GF's mom was a doctorate.",0
relationships,"My GF's mom openly told in front of my that she didn't earn enough for the years of study and work she did, everybody in our country knows that doctorates don't earn enough money for the effort, capacity and dedication they're required to do/have.",0
relationships,"But when my dad said those words, nobody said anything.",0
relationships,I didn't take it as offensive.,0
relationships,"Been together for 5 years, married for 1 year.",0
relationships,My husband outwardly reserved/introverted but he's also very goofy around me.,0
relationships,We joke around and are playful with each other in most interactions unless it comes to serious subjects.,0
relationships,"Lots of teasing, tickling, and 'play wrestling' in our home.",0
relationships,"The problem has always been when it comes to, umm, being romantic.",0
relationships,So I met this guy about 9 months ago at a meet-up group.,0
relationships,We used to go out for drinks every other weekend and he'd always come on to me.,0
relationships,We ended up hooking up a few times when drunk and became sort-of friends w/ benefits.,0
relationships,It was the first time I'd done anything like that but he seemed like a natural flirter.,0
relationships,"But after a while, some personal stuff got in the way of his life and he took a break from the drinking/partying etc.",0
relationships,I want to start off by saying I love my in laws.,0
relationships,They do a LOT for us and we are incredibly grateful for them.,0
relationships,"My MIL has always been around to babysit when I’ve needed to go to doctors appts, and seeing that she has MS (not severe), my SIL comes over to help play/do the lifting.",0
relationships,"My mil is capable of all of that, but she has a harder time.",0
relationships,We have a history with my SIL.,0
relationships,We went from completely being strangers to being absolutely the best of friends.,0
relationships,"And im talking about a person who says the same things at the same time, perfectly understands your point, same faith, same songs you listen to, just so much coincidence happening during those 8 months that made me believe in fate, destiny - whatever you call it.",0
relationships,"And im 28, i've had 2 exes.",0
relationships,Both long term.,0
relationships,Ive never been single since I was 17.,0
relationships,"We met and it went really well - he's a super sweet, smart, and thoughtful kid (just like his dad).",0
relationships,"It turns out that the kid has (VERY recently - after I met his dad) been dealing with some mental health issues - he texted a friend that he was suicidal, and his parents have been scrambling to get him help because they are not sure if he has depression or something else.",0
relationships,He's since started therapy and seems to be doing ok but obviously they are very concerned.,0
relationships,I listened and was very supportive when he told me (I've dealt with my fair share of mentally ill family members) and I could tell he really appreciated it.,0
relationships,We talked about it a few more times after that day.,0
relationships,I moved out of our family home and in with my boyfriend nearly 2 years ago.,0
relationships,"Since then we’d speak a bit over text, mainly for each others birthdays.",0
relationships,Last time we spoke via text was about three months ago.,0
relationships,I asked Eva if she wanted tickets to a concert for a band that we both really like and had seen in concert together before.,0
relationships,"She said yeah, but was less than enthusiastic when I gave her the ticket a week later when I went to visit.",0
relationships,I've been dating this guy for nearly three months.,0
relationships,"We met at a bar and had a one night stand, so my expectations were very low.",0
relationships,We started by taking it slow (dinner or takeout and a movie on Saturdays) but things felt really nice and normal.,0
relationships,I'm used to meeting guys on apps where everything is a game and usually they are dating multiple people at once; this felt different.,0
relationships,We met before Thanksgiving and managed to keep the momentum going through a lot of travel and three weeks spent apart.,0
relationships,As someone in there house is no longer going to be living with them as a mutual agreement.,0
relationships,I get along really well with some people in this agreed group and they are far more enthusiastic and keen than the others I mentioned above.,0
relationships,I discussed with this group prior to the free slot that it would be lovely to live with them if possible and now that they have a slot it's actually possible.,0
relationships,Since that happened I agreed to live take the slot with them.,0
relationships,Having a house with them (five of us total) and I think it's in my best interest as they are a tight friend group meaning communication to sort it out is easier and they're more assertive - four of them are also taking the same subject as me.,0
relationships,"I meet a great guy, we connect immediately due to same interests.",0
relationships,"I like him a lot, he likes me too.",0
relationships,"We go on a few dates, everything goes smoothly - the conversation is still heated, the guy still shows enthusiasm regarding going out with me or me in general.",0
relationships,"After a few dates, we end up either having sex or doing something sexual, and then it all cools down.",0
relationships,The conversations go at a much slower pace up to the point where we stop talking at all.,0
relationships,Neither did I.,0
relationships,"This turned to weeks, months and before I knew it it was a year.",0
relationships,I was bitter.,0
relationships,I never received an apology and felt no consideration for my feelings regarding anything was there.,0
relationships,I get confused sometimes as to why in my teen years I was okay with talking to her.,0
relationships,She's okay if you say a rude joke back though so she can take it too.,0
relationships,"She pokes fun at my lifestyle (I count calories by weighing things in grams, get my eyebrows waxed, go to the gym 5 days a week and jogging 1 day no matter the weather).",0
relationships,"She is also way ahead in school, and will have a bachelor's at 19 from her university, while I am in my freshman year.",0
relationships,"She also has a job in her field this year, she makes like $17 an hour and I work at a grocery store barely getting through freshman year while she's killing her senior classes.",0
relationships,During our conversation about weird way girls have hit on me I asked about her and she listed way more weird guys than I had weird girls and I know she's hot and I know currently she has multiple offers to go Netflix and chill or go out (I've seen her open snapchats from these boys like over her shoulder while we've been hanging out).,0
relationships,"Does he actually like me, or am I going to end up just hanging out with this guy?",0
relationships,"He hasn't made a move yet, so I'm inclined to think the latter.",0
relationships,Any idea how to stop getting myself in these situations?,0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: I end up in confusing friendships with men that blur the lines between ""relationship"" and ""friendship.""",0
relationships,"No we do not have sex everyday, yes we both work, no its not a problem of the change.",0
relationships,"I should have said ""I'm usually successful 1 out of 4 times I attempt to initiate.""",0
relationships,I just want to make sure that I am still crossing my i's and dotting my t's on my end or if I should ask her if there's any improvements I could make.,0
relationships,---   **tl;dr**: Do most relationships die down in the bedroom after a while?,0
relationships,"I mean that type of behavior is just weird, I don't understand how someone can still hang out with their friends every day almost like theyre in high school.",1
relationships,His job is kind of low demand (bartender and has an internship at an office) so i guess he just has a lot of free time... but still.,0
relationships,What am I supposed to think?,1
relationships,---   **tl;dr**: Boyfriend hangs out with his friends constantly and im worried this is a sign of immaturity.,1
relationships,I had an anxiety attack.,0
relationships,"When we returned home, I put my foot down.",0
relationships,"I told him that his behavior towards me was unacceptable; above all, as my (then future) husband, he needed to put my comfort and well-being above all other considerations as I did with him.",1
relationships,"He listening, apologized profusely, and we have not had any further issues with this.",0
relationships,Until today.,0
relationships,"So I pursued him, invited him to come out drinking with our friend group a couple times and slept with him early on.",0
relationships,We continued sleeping with each other and I guess fell into a FWB situation (though he wanted us to be exclusive and we were).,0
relationships,In the beginning it was mostly us going out to bars and me coming to his house to have sex.,0
relationships,"We got on really well and it wasn't just a sex thing, but it seemed like it wasn't going to turn into a relationship and I was fine with that.",0
relationships,Mostly because he didn't seem really concerned with it.,0
relationships,A few weeks ago I found some notes of hers open at our computer.,0
relationships,She had written questions to ask for a psychic reading or some such(she's into that stuff).,0
relationships,"One of them was, ""is this guy worth pursuing?""",0
relationships,"""This guy"" refers to an online friend from out of state she had been having extensive conversations with, which we had talked about not long before, and of course she labeled him as ""just a friend"", albeit him growing more and more fascinated with her.",0
relationships,"I offered an open relationship, partly because I had entertained the idea before, but mostly to de-escalate what could be a relationship ending event.",0
relationships,"He wasn't ambitious or motivated anymore, he was sad, depressed, always pessimistic and never really doing any work.",0
relationships,"I ended up not only doing all development work, but also our social, PR and leg work as well here in NYC making relationships.",0
relationships,This lead him to feel more left out I am assuming.,0
relationships,Many times he has decided to hinder the business due to reasons related to what I mentioned.,0
relationships,"For instance, one time we were creating an ad for a campaign we were running for the app.",0
relationships,So I tried posting a similar post last week and had technical difficulties so here it goes.,0
relationships,I think I’m going to do this chronologically— High school: I become close to someone who will become known as one of my best friends.,0
relationships,Let’s call her Jessie.,0
relationships,"I want to pursue a friendship because Jessie is a strong independent woman mature beyond her years, has a sassy Latina attitude, and we have the same sense of humor.",0
relationships,"We've known each other for 9 years, were FWB for about 3 years, then moved into the committed monogamous relationship we're in now, and have been in for 2 years.",0
relationships,"I've really enjoyed everything about our relationship, as she's taught me more than anyone ever has, and has been the best at putting up with any and all things that have come up.",0
relationships,"About halfway through the first year, she began asking if I'd ever be okay with her experimenting with a girl, or if I'd ever consider her having other sex friends.",0
relationships,"She doesn't want serious relationships with them, she only wants to bang.",0
relationships,"Having never been asked that in any of my previous relationships, I told her I wasn't sure and that were I ever 100% on board with that idea, I'd let her know.",0
relationships,She used the money from her moms house to buy her own.,0
relationships,"That was a couple weeks in a hotel, but we thought it was strong of her to be able to leave her abusive husband, and purchase a house so quickly.",0
relationships,"BACKSTORY LEADING TO: Right about 3 months ago, my petty cash came up missing ($200.00).",0
relationships,I reported it immediately.,0
relationships,"She keeps using the phrase ""right now"".",0
relationships,"Whenever I ask her about us she says ""right now, no, but in the future who knows?""",0
relationships,I decided to put no contact measures into place as I could not give her what she wants while staying in contact with her.,0
relationships,"As much as it pained me to stop talking to her, I know that I need to do this for her as well as for myself.",1
relationships,"When this happened she was bawling over the phone, but she never questioned it.",1
relationships,"I've been with my girlfriend since I was I was 16, and there are no real problems.",0
relationships,"For the past few months, I don't find myself enjoying being around her anymore, enjoy talking to her, or wanting to do anything ""special"" in general like I used to.",0
relationships,I'm not interested in anybody else by any means.,0
relationships,"She has helped me with a lot, would do anything or me, and has never done anything to hurt me or cheated.",0
relationships,"She's the best partner you could ask for, but even still when she talks I don't want to listen.",0
relationships,"But we didn't talk about it the morning after, and life went on.",0
relationships,"Over the next year, we would continue to stay up late at house parties or whatever the occasion was (until 3, 4, 5 AM) about once a month, and just talk and talk and talk, until we inevitably hooked up.",0
relationships,Keep in mind he was still dating someone else.,0
relationships,"Eventually during one of these moments, I worked up the courage to indirectly get a pulse on his feelings.",0
relationships,"More or less, he said he thinks about me multiple times a day, which was different from anyone else he ""dated"" prior.",0
relationships,"She never disclosed any of this to me, and probably never would have if the embassy hadn't discovered it first.",0
relationships,"In her words, she was afraid I would lose all interest in her if I found out she was married before.",0
relationships,"Truth be told, I likely would have, as I was still young when we first met.",0
relationships,She claims she left that husband because of the abuse she received from him and his relatives ((still lived with his parents)).,1
relationships,"I was crushed at that time, as we had only been married for about a month.",0
relationships,Whats the chances of his employer asking for his certificate randomly?,0
relationships,I feel like he cant apply to other jobs at more prestigious companies.,0
relationships,"As someone who who tried very hard to get her degree and succeeded, his lack of care and access to these jobs undermines my work.",1
relationships,I cant shake this feeling.,1
relationships,Advice?,0
relationships,"My mom [54F] has catered to his every need since marriage, and although she complains about it constantly, she still goes along with it.",0
relationships,"Although he uses his anger to attempt to show others ""he's the boss"" and can order them around, I believe he's a weak coward inside who loses all control when he becomes afraid or upset (I'll provide examples below).",0
relationships,"There are some events concerning him that have occurred throughout my life that have caused me to come to resent him (and my mom too sort of): From as far back as I can remember, to this day (although it's much less now), my parents have had screaming matches.",0
relationships,"My dad's face turning red and spit flying, as he yells and often curses at the top of his lungs to my mom, and her crying and screaming back.",1
relationships,It was a bit cringe because she was acting just too over the top.,1
relationships,But I did give her the benefit of the doubt because that could have just been her character.,0
relationships,However the things she were saying were very icky for my liking and I was uncomfortable about 10 minutes in.,0
relationships,It’s very vague in my mind as it was a while ago but what I remember was that She said “ I hope you dont mind Harry cuddling me when I’m poorly and when we Netflix and chill” and “what are WE doing Friday?” (Me and Harry arranged a date night as we were both off work and college on this day. ),0
relationships,I remember looking at harry and kind of giving him a confused WTF look.,0
relationships,I started noticing her internet behavior more over the past few months and it's been kind of bothering me.,0
relationships,"My girlfriend is a very intelligent and mature person, but when she gets online it's like she acts totally different.",0
relationships,"For one, she sends me screencaps of her ""trolling"" people.",0
relationships,"I mean, trolling?",0
relationships,She's almost 30.,0
relationships,The first is my girlfriend of around 9 months.,0
relationships,She doesn't really like her current living situation and suggested we look together.,0
relationships,"The positives here are that we get along pretty well as far as my relationships have gone, and it would save me money, probably around $5-600 a month.",0
relationships,That's not insignificant.,0
relationships,"The thing is I probably *could* be ready for that step if I had to, I'm just not really for or against it.",0
relationships,"Alright, I'll try to keep this as short as possible.",0
relationships,**Some Background:** I have a co-worker we'll call Pamela.,0
relationships,"Pamela is disabled from complications and defects from when she was born; she has a brain shunt, and some cognitive issues.",0
relationships,"However, it's not enough to impair her too greatly obviously because she has worked in the call center I work at for about 12 years or so, and in other call centers before this.",0
relationships,"She receives accommodations for a disability at work though, such as having to meet less strict stats (like time per phone call, or time spent working offline) and being allowed to take a ""rest"" break if her disability causes her issues.",0
relationships,"This has caused quite a few disagreements, as we often compromise for a ""quickie"" at some later time.",0
relationships,"I hate to admit it, but I can sense that we have both been feeling this incompatibility grow more and more apparent as our relationship has gone on, and both of our gained weight is not helping with our situation.",1
relationships,"I love her dearly, and want to make this work, but I'm also worried that I shouldn't have gone this far into a relationship without a frame of reference for what I would want in one.",0
relationships,"She is my first girlfriend, but I'm afraid to throw away a relationship that's caused me to love someone so dearly.",0
relationships,"I've been cautious up to this point, but it does appear as though we have begun to get financially ""entangled"".",0
relationships,"And it may be a bit out of context, but I do have to thank my 4 best men for being here with me all the way, I couldn’t do this without them.",0
relationships,"Finally, we are here at the present day.",0
relationships,It’s been 2 years since we broke up.,0
relationships,"My ex still hates me with a burning passion, but I have learned to ignore it and have mostly moved on from the experience.",1
relationships,"I don’t hold any sort of animosity towards her, but I have had the tendency to start to drift off and start pitying myself and reflecting out loud a bit too much when in conversation with my dear friend.",0
relationships,Hi everyone.,0
relationships,I met a great guy - let's call him Dave - about a year ago.,0
relationships,We started off as friends but started dating around November.,0
relationships,Let me preface this by saying that Dave is probably the best boyfriend I've ever had.,0
relationships,"He'll drive an hour just to see me, always pays when we go out for food or drinks and is reluctant even when I insist to pay.",0
relationships,"I do not originate from that country, but my family lives only a 3 hour ride away.",0
relationships,After Christmas (which we did not spend together) I came to visit her and her family and eventually spend New Years Eve with them.,0
relationships,"It was all fine apart from some little ""fights"" between my gf and me.",0
relationships,There were always some small things that led to discussions.,0
relationships,"For example: We went out with the dog and when we got back, my shoes were pretty dirty.",0
relationships,"She didn’t have room for it where she was currently living, it had been so long since she was able to create.",0
relationships,"We moved things out of storage, into the studio.",0
relationships,I was so excited to not only be providing this place for her but to be the one she trusted with some of the most precious things to her.,0
relationships,"I bought her a clay wheel and accessories, she wanted to work in the medium again.",0
relationships,"I’ll never forget the first evening we threw clay together, it was very meaningful and romantic.",0
relationships,"When we got to Food Lion, she got out of the car and said, “Your daddy bought you this car.” And slammed the car door and left.",0
relationships,She apologized later.,0
relationships,"New Years eve, my mom (65) gets a call from my cousin (50-60 don’t know her age), the primary caregiver for my grandma, that my uncle (same uncle from earlier) was admitted to the hospital the day before and was ready to be released.",0
relationships,She couldn’t pick him up because she lives an hour away.,0
relationships,My mom and I picked him up and took him home.,0
relationships,I dated my ex-girlfriend for 6 years.,0
relationships,She was madly in love with me for most of the relationship then had a falling out in the last year of the relationship where things turned ugly.,0
relationships,I went through depression and hit a rough patch which also made me insecure which gave her the power in the relationship.,0
relationships,"I also put us both through some unnecessary times and abused the love and time she gave me, she tried really hard, I was too stubborn.",0
relationships,Eventually near the end I was a bit vulnerable and she left.,0
relationships,"Sally is around the same age, 25 I assume, (can’t confirm numbers, sorry about that) and she quickly became a red flag for me.",0
relationships,He would mention her name occasionally and how our love for the same type of shows was shared with Sally.,0
relationships,Sally and I met a few times.,0
relationships,The first time was when we planned a day out shopping with a mutual friend who was single at the time and my bf decided to invite Sally.,0
relationships,"I thought that was a little weird, but justified it because 1) I had never met her and thought that would be a great opportunity to and 2) He said maybe the two of them would hit it off.",0
relationships,--- TL;DR; Ghosted after over a month of talking to a guy.,0
relationships,Met in hotel room.,0
relationships,Made out but didn't have sex.,0
relationships,If he didn't want to cheat or chickened out at the last minute why would he carry on so long with me?,0
relationships,She would be coming to the states for the first time in over 10 years on Dec. 30.,0
relationships,I was ecstatic to finally meet my MIL.,0
relationships,We've chatted on several occasions and she is truly a great person.,0
relationships,Rob was excited too so he wanted to make her trip memorable.,0
relationships,He decided he wanted to get a family portrait painted for her as a late Christmas gift.,0
relationships,Anna claimed he was a distant friend and had been kicked out of his house in the frigid weather.,0
relationships,"My mom said nope, no way that boy stays there.",0
relationships,Anna seemed to be telling lies again.,0
relationships,"Fast forward a few days, and Anna's mother takes her phone away after a series of lies and deceit.",0
relationships,"It turns out, the man was not a distant friend.",0
relationships,"She already knows the password to my laptop, email, bank account, and phone PIN.",0
relationships,"I didn't really want to tell her any of those, but I could not think of a reason why not to.",0
relationships,"When I got a new phone, she set up my new PIN and got a bit upset when I changed it.",0
relationships,"She said if I had nothing to hide, then she should know my passwords.",0
relationships,"I don't have anything to hide, so I told her.",0
relationships,He would tell me it was the best university in the world(a white lie) and how great it was.,0
relationships,I didn't want to go there.,0
relationships,I didn't aid in the application process at all.,0
relationships,He did everything.,0
relationships,"He wanted me to go there because it was cheap, and he assumed that if it were otherwise either i would just do nothing or spend a lot more money on school than he'd like.",0
relationships,all the sudden all the hate turned against me again (happened often before).,0
relationships,"She yelled out, whining for her dad, who she called.",0
relationships,i stayed calm but was totally clueless about what to do.,1
relationships,"she started breaking up with me, telling me that she will spent the night at a hotel or somewhere on the street.",0
relationships,i shouldnt come visit her at the hospital next week ... blackmailing me basically.,1
relationships,She did not acknowledge his invite to come down for Christmas.,0
relationships,Then they go on the trip 2 days later and everything is peachy keen.,0
relationships,-Her car broke down so my dad leant her my mom's car that we still have.,0
relationships,"She said that he needed to quit referring to it as my mom's car....like, legally it's my mom's car.",0
relationships,Shut it.,0
relationships,I agreed and the four of us had dinner and I dropped them back home to Kate[18F]'s house where they were staying the night because her parents were not home.,0
relationships,"As I was pulling away Jamie[17F] ran up to my car and asked me if I wanted to stay the night with them, at first I was hesitant but I eventually agreed because I thought other guys were coming round.",0
relationships,It turned out the other guys couldnt make it and it was just me and the three drunk girls.,0
relationships,I asked Kate[18F](it was her house) if I could get some MDMA and drop it tonight and she agreed if I got her some.,0
relationships,I drove us to the bottle shop where Jamie[17F] got her friend to buy us some more alcohol and went to get the MDMA which me and Kate did while Jamie and Sophie just drank.,0
relationships,"Now, this was my first long term serious relationship and at the time, i wasn’t aware if what he was asking me to do was normal or not.",0
relationships,"But i loved him with everything i had, so i gave up my oldest and greatest friendship for this guy i loved.",0
relationships,Who ruined me.,0
relationships,"Myself and Alex have always been a bit flirty, but never made a move on one another.",0
relationships,"He would come to me about relationship advice, i never before had feelings for him and i would help him wholeheartedly with any issues he had.",0
relationships,Maybe 2-3 crazy fights but nothing major.,0
relationships,"Joe came back, frankly Joe spent ~ a year asking me to go out with him and my gut did not agree, it just felt off, now don’t get me wrong I have loved Joe since I was 17 but I just felt like this wouldn’t be right.",0
relationships,"I asked Joe for a year, I studied far away, and it was my last year at uni, I asked Joe to give me that year.",0
relationships,But Joe said Nah.,0
relationships,"Joe gave the whole I have changed speech which every girl has probably heard a gazillion times in her life, but still thinks its novel.",0
relationships,"He is (objectively) pretty unlikable- only talks about himself when speaking to you- but you know, I try to see the best in people and ignored it when I talk to him.",0
relationships,He claims he is bisexual.,0
relationships,"He introduced me to his lab partner, my current girlfriend, and I asked him if he was interested before pursuing her.",0
relationships,He stated clearly no.,0
relationships,"Fast forward three months, it is winter break, and they are hanging out a bit frequently.",0
relationships,So let’s say I like person b [16F] and recently went on a date with her.,0
relationships,"Person b [16F] tells me that my best friend is telling his girlfriend (who is person b’s best friend) everything that me, person c[16M] (our best friend as well), and other boyfriend discuss as a group of really tight friends.",0
relationships,And I mean everything.,0
relationships,"Person b doesn’t want me to say anything, but should I confront other boyfriend, tell friend c, or just shrug it off?",1
relationships,**TL;DR** Us three guys have been friends for three years now and met these girls about 6 months ago; what should I do?,0
relationships,"I have known her for several years and we are somewhat close but not ""best friends"".",0
relationships,She confided in me that her brother died and I want to be there for her in any way that I can.,0
relationships,I currently live 5+ hrs away from where she lives so I can't physically be there for her.,0
relationships,Are there any sayings that I should avoid or use?,0
relationships,What helped you after the loss of a loved one?,0
relationships,"EDIT: I should also mention that when I do fall asleep, I snore REALLY loudly and I can hear myself in my sleep.",0
relationships,My boyfriend says that it sounds like I'm not breathing or trying to breathe.,0
relationships,---   **tl;dr**: I can't stay awake during tv/movies!,0
relationships,Don't want it to drive a wedge between my boyfriend and I.,0
relationships,No reply.,0
relationships,I texted again a couple hours later and he again didn't reply.,0
relationships,I saved myself the embarrassment and just didnt go out that night.,0
relationships,I texted him the next day to ask what happened.,0
relationships,Its been a week already since this happened and be hasn't once texted me.,0
relationships,And after every episode with them he treats me like shit for a couple hours at work I assume wondering if I know about his behaviour and if I’ll say anything.,1
relationships,I completely ignore it and refuse to let it invade our work environment.,1
relationships,"It’s my world, and my people, and I’m his superior.",0
relationships,"He’s not going to win a power struggle, so I don’t even have to worry about it.",0
relationships,Other days we get along fine from 9-5.,0
relationships,"I am moving in with my BF and am fine with doing it 'early' because I love him and want to spend more time with him, I am moving back to my hometown where I have a large safety net, and we are choosing an apartment that he can afford on his own if he needs to.",0
relationships,"I know having a back up plan doesn't sound romantic, but both he and I have discussed all of the above, and both of us are long term planners who place 'back-up' plans in place in case anything goes awry.",0
relationships,I have always been in relationships where I was still able to be an independent unit and avoid too much commitment because I was always scared to lose my independence.,0
relationships,"But this is the first relationship where I feel like we're a really good fit, and it doesn't feel like a sacrifice I don't want to make.",0
relationships,"I will still be doing a lot of things on my own, he is also an independent person, and both of us have lived on our own for years and know we can take care of ourselves.",0
relationships,I apologised and thought that was the end of it.,0
relationships,"It’s gotten to the point that if I walk into a room, she’ll leave straight away, and if she doesn’t leave, or if I start talking to her or someone else, she sighs a lot so I know my presence is not wanted.",0
relationships,"If I’m in her general direction of travel, she’ll be sure to make a wide berth around me, and the only time she’s spoken a full sentence to me was to say “thanks for my present” that I got her for Christmas.",0
relationships,Then we get to tonight.,0
relationships,Eva and one of my brothers are staying over at our cousins house.,0
relationships,I'll have written a letter to give to her.,0
relationships,The letter is to repeat what I wanted to say for later so that she can read in case she has any misunderstandings or if I don't communicate it well.,0
relationships,I don't know how to word my reasons to break up though.,1
relationships,Obviously I don't want to say the reason is because of her physical appearance.,0
relationships,Should I say I only see her as a friend but nothing greater than that?,0
relationships,Alright Alright Alright.,0
relationships,I've been dating a single mom with two kids from two different guys who help out.,0
relationships,She was married to the first for several years and has a 2 year old with the other.,0
relationships,I've never had any kids myself.,0
relationships,She is highly involved daily with many of the people that have been apart of her previous lives and relationships.,0
relationships,My boyfriend M(26) and I have been dating for a year and a half.,0
relationships,We live together.,0
relationships,We definitely have issues were working through right now but our relationship has been pretty good.,0
relationships,Up until a month or so ago I was making all these future plans with him and so on.,0
relationships,I’ve been on and off taking antidepressants for the past 8 months.,0
relationships,Normal start of our day.,0
relationships,"He asked ""was the card worth the wait?""",0
relationships,"I answered ""Yes, I cried, at the park"" he jokingly said ""of course you did, tiny tears x"" and then he asked ""did you take photos of the chocolates?""",0
relationships,"I said ""yes babe"" and sent him the photo - he was still online but the last 2 messages wasnt read.",0
relationships,"The next message i sent was all about my day - that wasnt sent anymore, he was offline... i thought he was getting ready for his work and his phone died or his network... after an hour, I got worried, so I sent messages on all social media that he has, which I know.",0
relationships,"I had no problem with that, but was kind of surprised that this was the first time I was hearing his cousin's name that he missed so dearly he spent 600 dollars on a plane ticket to go visit.",0
relationships,"I did not think much of it, but noticed that over the course of a couple weeks, he was constantly getting snapchats from Jessica, but was reluctant to open them in front of me.",0
relationships,"That was another thing that surprised me because he always would open things in front of me, and never had a problem with me on his phone.",0
relationships,"If he did open a snapchat from Jessica, he kind of pulled his phone closer to him so I couldn't see his screen.",0
relationships,"I noticed his phone background one day, and saw that it was a happy birthday card with a picture drawn on it, signed from Jessica.",0
relationships,When we had our first fight I did EVERYTHING I could to gain her back in my life.,0
relationships,"I quit smoking cigarettes because she went on a ""I hate all drugs and anything smokable"" rant.",0
relationships,I tried to be more mindful and kind because she said I was the opposite.,0
relationships,I tried to change because I wanted my best friend back.,0
relationships,4 months later she let me back in and I was so fucking happy.,0
relationships,My girlfriend and I met through a messaging app.,0
relationships,"We come from the same country and speak the same language, so there is a sense of familiarity and closeness right from the start.",0
relationships,"However, as we grow closer, I'm starting to feel like she does not value our relationship as much as I do.",0
relationships,I always put her above all else.,0
relationships,I always try to find ways to accommodate her busy schedule.,0
relationships,Some day it’s gonna piss them off and she’ll get killed.,0
relationships,She lets people go ahead of her in line if she has more items than them.,0
relationships,She lets people out of junctions even if she’s running late to places.,0
relationships,Ends up holding doors open for tons of people and can get stuck there for almost a minute.,0
relationships,Gave up her seat on a bus once when she knows I have a bad back and like to sit down.,0
relationships,"I've never been on this side of the road, being the one to let someone know I'm not interested.",0
relationships,I wouldn't know how to go about letting her know without completely devastating her.,1
relationships,"I know there is a risk no matter what I say, but how should I go about it gently.",0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Person wants to hook me up with his adoptive sister, we have nothing in common, how do I tell her that I'm not interested?",0
relationships,I want that.,0
relationships,I want him as well as a SO but maybe I need more time.,0
relationships,Its not fair to him.,1
relationships,Maybe I'm more invested than even he is.,0
relationships,I don't know,0
relationships,"At some point in the past year, we discussed living together.",0
relationships,She seemed to be okay with it and never had any objections.,0
relationships,"Since both our rental agreements will soon expire (hers in May and mine in July), I started looking for a new place online.",0
relationships,"However, I noticed that she never really responded enthusiastically about anything I showed her or just plain ignored it.",0
relationships,"Last weekend, I confronted her and she admitted that she no longer wants to move in together, saying it is too soon for her and that she had been thinking about it for a long time.",0
relationships,My girlfriend and I have been dating now for 3 months.,0
relationships,We have a very happy relationship most of the time.,0
relationships,I love her and she loves me and we spend almost all our time together.,0
relationships,She can be insecure at times and has a couple mood swings where she can be very happy to very upset.,0
relationships,I do my best to bring her out of those slumps and usually I do.,0
relationships,Email her?,0
relationships,"She lives in his hometown, so an in-person meeting is not possible, nor do I think it would be wise.",0
relationships,Should I do it anonymously?,0
relationships,"Should I provide screen shots of our conversations right off the bat, or wait and see if she requests it?",0
relationships,I feel like I may only have one shot to do this and want to make sure I do it right.,0
relationships,I could write a long book about it.,0
relationships,The issue: My current issue is a strange one and I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts about it.,0
relationships,"Whenever my inlaws visit and stay the night, they bring 1 set of clean clothes and wash the ones they are wearing EVERY NIGHT.",0
relationships,They do this regardless of the number of nights they are staying.,0
relationships,I began to see a therapist and started taking some medication for my mood.,0
relationships,I was really trying to improve myself.,0
relationships,"The first medication I tried, I now believe, made things like social anxiety worse.",0
relationships,I recently found a medication (Zoloft) that has changed my life.,0
relationships,"I had been exercising, going out of my way to connect with old friends who I like in an effort to curb the isolation etc.",0
relationships,So I've been dating my current girlfriend for 6 months now.,0
relationships,Everything has been great.,0
relationships,"We get along great, haven't had any fights, sex is still amazing, all that.",0
relationships,"I've owned a condominium for 7 years, and its a decent sized 2 bedroom, 1 1/2 bath.",0
relationships,"Well, her lease runs out at the end of July, and I'm toying with the idea of inviting her to move in with me.",0
relationships,"He says she is a great girl, caring for him and he thinks she loves him.",0
relationships,"He, however, felt mostly intense passion and says he misses the spiritual connection.",0
relationships,"I think its still too soon for him to know after a few days, as the group of friends returned home and he is some more time on the road.",0
relationships,"He said even if he does not know what will happen, he must explore the passion with the new girl and he is happy that it happened.",0
relationships,He said he feels a bit guilty cause its mostly passion he feels and the girl seems to be really into him.,0
relationships,"The problem is that before I even ask for him to do this like a grown up, I have gone fully Zuko fire bender mode and decided to unleash my wrath on Joe for not doing this.",1
relationships,Other stupid occasions I have done this?,0
relationships,"Well, did it cause when we were long distance he wouldn’t initiate calling (I know Joe too well to know this is just unnatural for him), holding my hand more than he does, coming home and giving me a kiss, honestly he has a faster pace and I even equated him sometimes not walking at my pace as him not caring.",0
relationships,What has Joe actually done to show me he cares?,0
relationships,"He puts up with my rage and abuse, he helps with my mother (who is nuts herself, so I guess I take after her), he has offered financial help if I need it (doing MSc).",0
relationships,"So besides my dad, my entire family is toxic to me.",1
relationships,My mum and older sister uses guilt a lot.,0
relationships,My mum storms off on a regular basis and says no one cares about her or whatever.,0
relationships,My older sister does the same thing too but instead she verbalises it and says ‘FINE IF I DIE EVERYONE WILL BE BETTER OFF’.,0

relationships,"Well, Tyler fills up his truck (it is never under $120), fills up the four-wheeler ($60), and Zack walks over to our house with nothing but a helmet.",0

relationships,"AKA, I don’t get to go anymore.",0
relationships,He agreed.,0
relationships,"I told him a million times, when we were together and after we broke up, that loyalty is my #1 in relationship, period.",0
relationships,I hate cheaters more than anything in the world.,1
relationships,He knew that from the very beginning.,0
relationships,Yet recently found out that I was cheated on for more than 6 months before we broke up.,0
relationships,"Despite that, all the following is true: * We have both called each other BF/GF and referred to there being a relationship * We have had (oral, but not PIV yet) sex a few times, slept together naked, and have had many intimate conversations, including the last time we saw each other * We both mentioned early on that we aren't currently dating anyone else * We have both talked about going to specific events and doing things together in the future",0

relationships,We laugh a lot and we have the same sense of humor.,0
relationships,I have been known as sort of a funny person and this is the first girl I’ve been with in a relationship that consistently makes me laugh hard.,0

relationships,I was upset and it took a couple of years of us discussing this before I started to feel more comfortable with things.,0
relationships,"We eventually started swinging (only about once every couple of months and always same room) as it seemed like a way for us to explore this part of her together, and it ended up being a lot of fun and something I really enjoyed that brought us closer together.",0
relationships,"Well, it’s been a couple of years and I’ve felt happy and comfortable with where we are at but  I decided to ask my wife the other day and she said she was happy but she also had a desire to date people separately, and would be willing to try it if I was.",0
relationships,This was really hard for me to hear.,0
relationships,"This isn't the first time this has happened, even with my ex I used to put effort into creating funny and deep conversations and she'd make quite surface level replies, but I thought it was because she was severely depressed so I didn't mind making an effort with her.",0
relationships,Am I missing something?,0
relationships,She doesn't have many hobbies and works in a pub so I can't talk about her interests really as the only think she kinda likes is textiles and she doesn't do it anymore as she's so focused on her job.,0
relationships,"I should probably mention she's really really shy, which she has admitted to me.",0

relationships,As title says.,0
relationships,"I have enough money to buy a house, my girlfriend has only just started working.",0
relationships,It seems to make financial sense for me to go ahead and make the purchase- I'd be paying toward my mortgage instead of rent and my girlfriend can stay and pay cheaper rent.,0
relationships,"However, when I spoke to her.",0

relationships,So I'm angry about that when I think about it.,1
relationships,"I can't talk like that.""",0
relationships,"He put a hand on my shoulder and smiled and said, ""You sure are.""",0
relationships,It goes in a circle.,0
relationships,He made me feel better there by affirming that he thinks I'm worthwhile.,0
relationships,"Great, that'll probably get on his nerves.",0
relationships,I’m not living a lavish lifestyle or rolling around in money.,0
relationships,I explained to her that if we divided rent based on income percentage she would actually be paying more per month.,0
relationships,All this on top of the fact that she turned down a free car.,0
relationships,It feels really unfair because I think she blames me for moving us to a “more expensive” location for my new job.,1
relationships,So in her mind she shouldn’t have to pay anything more than the dirt-cheap rent I was charging her to live with me at my house.,0
relationships,feel free to delete or disregard if this isn't in the right sub.,0
relationships,I saw a guy for months having sex a couple times a week.,0
relationships,"But not just that, hanging out and being friends too.",0

relationships,I am confident that training would fix 70% of the issues that she has with my dog.,0
relationships,Could there be something else deeply underlying that i am missing?,0
relationships,"To me a loving and healthy relationship is one that can come to compromises and that are no winners or losers, but agreements in place to help solve issues TOGETHER .",0

relationships,In the beginning of the week people asked what me and my Ex did.,0

relationships,I was spot on.,0
relationships,3.,0
relationships,"Since we are both the only child, we both feel an equal responsibility to carry on our family lines, regardless of our own gender.",0
relationships,What do you guys think would be an equitable solution to this problem?,0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Girlfriend wants future children to have her last name, but I am not comfortable with that due to social conditioning and/or the backlash I would face from my own parents.",0
relationships,"The new man almost immediately moved to the flat previously shared with her ex, which I found strange, but I know she cannot be alone, perhaps because of her troubled childhood/daddy issues.",0
relationships,"She later confessed she was completely out of her mind in this period, and she would not do it if having a clear head.",0
relationships,"They never really ended contact, despite all the hurt.",0
relationships,"She even met with her ex after 3 months apart, confessing she misses him and cried.",0
relationships,Since then things between them got complicated.,0

relationships,I asked her how long she was down for and she said the whole time as Annie was already downstairs.,0
relationships,"I asked her why she didn't let me know everyone was downstairs already, instead of just leaving me in my room by myself to which she replied ""don't worry about it, it's no big deal.""",0
relationships,"I said it seemed weird she just din't think to tell me for nearly half an hour to which she rolled her eyes and said ""oh don't you start.""",0
relationships,I decided it wasn't worth getting annoyed about it and didn't bring it up again.,0
relationships,"Any problem he had, he would blame on me.",0
relationships,"If I didn’t take his side during an disagreement he was having with someone else, he would get so mad and start with the insults.",1
relationships,"I eventually got out of the relationship, and when I ended it, he began obsessively texting me up to 30 times a day, talking to my family and lying to them about what was happening, etc.",1
relationships,He finally stopped when I threatened a restraining order.,1
relationships,The last time we talked was in May 2017.,0
relationships,I started my seizure while on the stairs and as a result was pretty badly injured.,0
relationships,I broke my ankle and injured my knee.,0
relationships,I also required stitches in my face.,0
relationships,Let me make this very clear- I recognize that this experience must have been **terrifying** for Tom.,0

relationships,"Also, stemming from the same background, I am still a virgin (he obviously is not) and I’m not quire sure how I feel about engaging in sexual intercourse with him.",0
relationships,"Whenever we “talk” about sex, I feel like I’m lying about how I feel.",0
relationships,It’s more of an interest in learning the different aspects of sex than actual sexual arousal (I’ve been questioning the possibility of asexuality).,0
relationships,"If anything, I feel kind of giddy that someone thinks of me in that way but not in the “I want to have sex with you” way.",0
relationships,"I’m trying to engage him with pictures/videos/etc., but it feels all fake to me.",0
relationships,The problem is one of these guy friends.,0
relationships,I'm typically pretty shy in new social settings and don't really like to make be at the focus of anyone's attention unless I'm comfortable with them.,0
relationships,"When I first met these guys, it was like 2 polar opposites met.",0

relationships,I can hardly step into his room because that is where it is most concentrated.,0
relationships,I love keeping a clean and nice smelling apartment.,0

relationships,bah.,0
relationships,"Anyway, couple months down the line, I met her family, loved them, they loved me (they're first impression of me was, get this, me clogging they're toileting and it overflowing with me yelling SOS through the bathroom door.. it was awesome lol).",0

relationships,Then March happened.,0
relationships,L started to act wierd.,0
relationships,"She talked sarcastically about how my life is ""obviously so horrible"" and I'd say ""yeah, mom, it is.""",0
relationships,"She denied yelling at us all the time, and said that if I can say she yells all the time then she can say I yell all the time too (at my little siblings), which is just not true.",0
relationships,"I am nice to my siblings, excluding today where I was angry at everything.",0
relationships,But I still didn't yell at them.,1
relationships,"She said that for months I've been terrorizing her about this ""yelling thing"" and how I think that one small mistake automatically means someone is a bad person.",0
relationships,Sorry if this is kinda long... We met in highschool and became best friends.,0
relationships,"Even after we still talked everyday, hang out almost every weekend and I felt everything was okay.",0
relationships,She then started getting kinda distant e cold toward me and I had no idea why.,0
relationships,I talked to friend in commom and she said my this friend(I'll call her P.) felt that I was too negative and was always complaining.,0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Met this guy a few months ago, we've only hung out a few times.",0
relationships,"I'm a little wary of the age gap and don't have much experience with accurately ""reading signals"".",0
relationships,"He is mildly physically affectionate (leans towards me, hits my arm playfully, pulls things from my hair) and gives compliments that seem genuine and sincere, but aren't quite non platonic.",0
relationships,What do you think/what should I look for?,0
relationships,"Hello all, I'm a new submitter to this channel.",0
relationships,I went here a few nights ago and honestly it's been helping me cope with my current situation by reading what others are going through.,0
relationships,"One of the things I noticed is that a lot of responses are brutally honest -- and I am here for just that while still accepting that I'm a hopeless romantic who sees the value in ""If you really want it don't give up"".",0
relationships,Let's get started -,0
relationships,My online friend  -- let's call him Jim  -- is a Jehovah's Witness.,0
relationships,I've known him on and off for about a decade.,0
relationships,"Nowadays, we only email each other about thrice a year, but I still consider him one of my favorite online friends because of how deep and insightful our conversations are.",0
relationships,We've rubbed each other the wrong way in the past because we have different ideas of God.,0

relationships,"For now, I’m just going to keep saving up money for the future, taking precautions and doing things to protect my own mental health.",1
relationships,"I am seeing a therapist for my anxiety, and the next time I have a session I’m going to bring get up everything I talked about here and maybe get some help in dealing with it.",0
relationships,"Again, thanks to everyone who took time out of their day to give me advice when I was struggling, I really appreciate it.",0
relationships,Sister kicked off because she wanted to come to.,0
relationships,"It was a couple type thing and all of us were bringing a SO or a friend (if one of us didn’t have a partner) even if it wasn’t, I would have just wanted it to be Harry.",0
relationships,As I don’t want his sister clinging on to us every single time.,0
relationships,Harry asked me if she could come too because “it so unfair that you are isolating her like this.” I stood my ground and said that please can he just come.,0
relationships,He said no.,0
relationships,"come up and live with us and she'd leave me alone with him, wasted out of his mind, while she would be with her boyfriend (who shes now married to).",0
relationships,Eventually I moved back with my dad and everything was fine.,0
relationships,I'd call and talk to her and she sounded like she had her life together.,0
relationships,"Well then they broke up for a short period of time, and she moved to live with her half siblings.",0
relationships,"She would drink excessively, and call me and cry about her life.",0
relationships,"I started talking to a girl, 'J', on Tinder about a month ago.",0
relationships,"She's funny, attractive and quick-witted, however she was apprehensive to meet up for a drink to get to know each other in person straight away.",0
relationships,We are both from the same town (we matched over Christmas) however she lives an hour and a half away in a much larger city.,0
relationships,"She first claimed that she could not afford to travel to see me even when she was back in my town (she also refused to let me pay for anything involving her, including travel to her city to meet her), however said last week that she did not want to meet me until she knew that I was genuine about her, and wanted to talk on the phone every evening for a week.",0
relationships,"If I did this, then she would meet me on the day afterwards.",0
relationships,"His mother would say, ""Who would love you if you look like that?""",0
relationships,"or ""Why couldn't I have a fit and handsome son.""",0
relationships,So he has his own issues with his body image and weight.,0
relationships,He also went a few years without being physical with anyone because he never thought that anyone would be interested or love him because of his appearance.,0
relationships,He had a few years where he got very fit and had six pack but eventually lost it as he got older.,0
relationships,"She never messaged him back, but I asked her why she still had him on Snapchat.",0
relationships,I only asked it because she had claimed to have deleted her ex's on social media.,0
relationships,"Whatever, that's a nice feeling and I'm glad, but at the same time it wouldn't really be an issue for me if she did still have them.",0
relationships,Fast forward to last night... My fiance was acting all weird and put out so I tried figure out what was going on and what she was upset about.,0
relationships,I have been trying to make plans recently and she keeps having things come up but i understand because i am doing it on kind of short notice.,0
relationships,This last little bit after the break happened in about a 8 day span.,0
relationships,TLDR: I am awkward and need some help with relationships.,0
relationships,I feel like i ruined my chances with this girl and i am hoping i can fix it.,0
relationships,I also may just be overreacting to things.,0
relationships,BACKGROUND: paul and i met 1.5 years ago on okcupid and hit it off right away.,0
relationships,"at the time, we were both in long-term open relationships with other people, so we fell into a pretty quick routine that involved seeing each other once a week for a meal or drinks and sex [the best of his life, allegedly].",0
relationships,"About 6 months into it/the December before last, he and his partner of 8 years broke up, which sent him into a bit of a depression/naturally intense period of introspection.",0
relationships,"Independently/for unrelated reasons, my own longterm relationship also came to an end.",0
relationships,Paul and I saw each other less but kept in touch.,0
relationships,to me I feel like that is someone older than my current age dating an age that seems like a child to me....,0
relationships,"I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a "" normal"" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any "" life skills"" and his answer was ""  not really"".",0
relationships,What are people's thoughts on this?,0
relationships,--- tl/dr...i'm creeped out by a man dating a woman 20 years younger even my last relationship was with a man 22 years older.,1
relationships,"* Her, a week ago: Precious, how are you?",0
relationships,(I ignored her.),0

relationships,** You are one of the best people I have met in my life (she says this twice) that you have always been here for everything and you always will be.,0
relationships,"We were talking about children, marriage, all kinds of things.",0
relationships,It's not that I thought she owed me something.,0
relationships,"It's just that I felt like I had done so many things and it kills me to look back and to know that over a period of 5 months, we had only less than 15 intimate contacts, that we never had outside sex (and I started and was rejected a lot, several times).",0
relationships,"Every time I raised my frustrations about my unsatisfied romantic needs, she took it as a light and used it as fuel to push further the reason why she was not comfortable with intimate contact.",0
relationships,"Okay, so since October just got out of an eight-year relationship.",0
relationships,"We were engaged to get married next year, but it didn't work.",0
relationships,It ended with each other and we moved on.,0

relationships,"I have a twin sister, Audrey, and I hate her.",0
relationships,I really can't explain it.,1
relationships,"I know it's so irrational, but that's how it is, and I hate it that it's like that.",1
relationships,"We both came home for our mother's birthday, and I couldn't even spend 20 minutes with her.",0
relationships,I think now that she feels a certain responsibility to help those in need and she gets a lot of satisfaction from those people who are very grateful to her.,0
relationships,"Occasionally when we go out, we were approached by these people and I can say that they are very grateful to her.",0
relationships,"We were at Starbucks while she was studying and the husband/wife she helped offer to buy her coffee, etc.",0

relationships,"It never seemed attractive to hang out in clubs or bars to get someone, I hope, so I mostly stuck to online meetings.",0
relationships,"I was looking mostly for a rather casual way, and I was going there when the mood hit me or I was talking to someone I saw potential with.",0
relationships,"I've never been very close to him, our conversations have never gone beyond the area of 'good time we have'.",0
relationships,"But, by coincidence, I met him in a bar recently and I first tried to keep my distance from him because I know he's friends with Zach, but then he told me that not only him and Zach are no longer in contact with each other, they actually really hate each other now.",0
relationships,I guess something fell after Zach and I broke up.,0
relationships,"We are 100% no contact, and have decided that we will not talk for at least a few months, or until we are ready to talk and perhaps try to be friends.",0
relationships,"He says that he still cares deeply about me and loves me, but it is for the best.",0

relationships,I think so.,0

relationships,"Later, he said 'it='s so easy to make you crazy that you shouldn't react in this way just cus you don't think you ‘re fat=' it made me think that he's doing this to get a lift of me that's not cool for 55 yo dad or you know an adult.",1
relationships,"Or another reason is probably cus he gets older and lives a style of life that's more sedentary, it's not me anymore, it's all about time to say that he's not cool for me, it's all about time to say that he's cool, and he's not about time to say that he's all.",0

relationships,I've been out a lot since the breakup and nobody clicked with me like he did.,0

relationships,I called text for about the first 2 weeks to see what was happening.,0
relationships,"So, I broke up with my boyfriend over a year earlier last month, and it was... hard.",0

relationships,I thought our breakup was mutual.,0
relationships,"She told me she was excited, I was just more excited about it.",0
relationships,"I dropped it, and we went out with friends for new years.",0
relationships,I've always felt that distance.,0
relationships,So here it is.,0
relationships,I have feelings for it.,0
relationships,They're just not the level of intensity I'm used to feeling when I fall for someone.,0
relationships,I normally have this feeling of urgency.,0
relationships,"It's this feeling of ""Crazy on you/can't live with you"" feeling type.",0
relationships,"When she got angry, she also insults me for that, that she can never forgive me that ive did that at that time.",0
relationships,"2 minutes later, she politely said that.",0
relationships,She's really fighting.,0
relationships,"She also said that we might not be sexually compatible, and that it was unfair to me if I stayed with her and supported her.",0
relationships,I obviously told her that I didn't want to break up and she didn't.,0
relationships,I offered her time alone and she was so unsure in herself that she didn't even know if she wanted to take me on the offer.,0

relationships,We had a lot in common and I really loved her.,0
relationships,Then I went back to my country for the Christmas holidays and I could see her.,0
relationships,It was really amazing and honestly it was much better than expected.,0
relationships,"Anyway, she has good grades and she's going to apply to the United States (probably the same university as mine or the same city).",0
relationships,"I'm 35 years old, husband 37 I always thought it would be ideal to have two children.. My husband was on board with the hypothetical idea but now that it's actually time to execute it is totally opposed to the idea His reasons are 1) He thinks we can't afford it...",0
relationships,He earns quite well but I'm not at the time.,0
relationships,So we won't really be able to build a major university fund for her--I think she can still take a loan later but she really can't lend a brother and sister.,0
relationships,"I'm lazy, which I can attest to.",0
relationships,"She raises the Christmas tree, and how we haven't removed it yet.",0
relationships,"I just stand in silence from her dam, then I take a bite from my sandwich.",0

relationships,She mentioned how she helped him commit suicide and that he was really a good person.,0
relationships,"I told him that if he wasn't careful, all that attention could make her fall in love with him.",0
relationships,"For a while, I noticed that the behavior would stop.",0
relationships,"He wouldn't stay up so late, they stopped working a little, the looks and flirting stopped, and I noticed that they didn't talk so much, because they both talked to me more.",0
relationships,"However, recently, he started again, and almost as loud as before.",0
relationships,"They do all the same things again, and they always make visual contact with the other or tease and flirt.",0

relationships,"Yes, they stayed in one way or another ""friends"" for years after this case.",0

relationships,The way she orders food and drinks makes me change my eating and drinking habits when I'm with her.,0
relationships,It's like I'm binging too.,0
relationships,She always apologizes to the bathroom right after a meal and I know she's purging.,0
relationships,"More recently, I spent time with her, I set her foot a little lower and told her that I didn't want to pay for so much food, and that I wasn't doing injections (I never do injections, but she still commands me when I go out with her and then it's really manipulative to force me to do them).",0
relationships,Everything was absolutely perfect.,0
relationships,"He is always very calm, but he is a complete love, and very warm and kind once he trusts someone.",0
relationships,He is pretty much the crunchy image of what I imagined of the person I would marry when I was young.,0
