relationships,I've been spooked when I've woken up because it's actually felt like he left and it happened.. can someone shed some light on what this means?,1
relationships,my boyfriend is 18 and I am 19 I am female he is male.,0
relationships,we have been in a relationship for around 6/7 months.,0
relationships,Recently me and my boyfriend had been going through a tough stage and I've been carrying a huge amount of guilt and I've been feeling like I'm not a good person at all...,1
relationships,"While my friends and myself included, have high hopes that this will work out, I’m petrified because I am putting my feelings on the table.",1
relationships,I’m going to be so damn vulnerable.,1
relationships,"While he’s expressed and shown signs that he’s just as into this as I am, if not more so, I’ve also never done this before.",0
relationships,"I’ve only been in 1 (college) relationship before this, followed by 3 years of singleness and ultimate casual fuckery.",0
relationships,I know my feelings for him are real and I owe it to myself to fight for a chance of a relationship with someone I feel so strongly for.,1
relationships,I'm just really scared in general of not living up to expectations my partner may have.,1
relationships,"A lot of my life is built on trying to be exciting, fun, or entertaining, I'm just scared I won't be able to keep it up for my partner.",0
relationships,"The last thing I want them is to describe their boyfriend (me) as bland or boring, but I feel like that's how I'll make them feel, and it'll just lead to heartache.",1
relationships,"So, I've come to the most recent conclusion (after seeing my two best friends get girlfriends and me being the awkward loser who can't get one).",0
relationships,That maybe I'm not the type of person who's built for relationships.,0
relationships,"We were doing so good.” I’m feel as if I can’t be angry at any of his actions, and my words mean nothing,  and my threats are empty.",1
relationships,"He makes me feel so horrible about myself when I even show the slightest bit of distance from him, he treats me as if I owe him sex.",1
relationships,"Never forces me to but will bring it up constantly, about how we haven’t and it’s just “makes him feel so bad and self conscious about himself” I don’t know what to do I told him I wanted to move back home and he went in behind me and unpacked my bags as I packed them.",1
relationships,That was nice.,0
relationships,"But now that we're close to the point of no return, with a flight booked so he can come see her(I agreed to travel out of our house for the week), and they seem to be bonding big time(I love you's abound), I'm not sure what to do with myself.",0
relationships,"On one hand I want to let loose and detach, let her have fun, and do so myself.",0
relationships,"If it leads to a new LTR for her, awesome.",0
relationships,But what kills me I guess is the uncertainty.,1
relationships,And I really don't know what to do.,1
relationships,This isn't nearly the first time he lied and there have also been other things (like him being unemployed for 6 months and not looking for a job while his parents pay foe everything and he lives with me).,0
relationships,But I get that life can be hard and it sometimes can get you down.,0
relationships,But I just feel like my trust is broken over and over and over again.,1
relationships,And I don't know what to do.,1
relationships,I was venting how pissed off she made me to one of my friends.,1
relationships,I didn't know [3M] was listening to our conversation.,0
relationships,He asked me and my friend what a period was.,0
relationships,My friend took him to his mother who was in the kitchen.,0
relationships,She just told us to keep an eye on him while she did some things.,0
relationships,I also want to set the record straight with my family.,0
relationships,What should I do?,0
relationships,Tldr : I dislike my mom for legitimate reasons.,0
relationships,She's telling my family it's because my head is all messed up from my mental illness.,1
relationships,It's gotten back to me and is making me angry and making me feel victimized and weird about myself all over again.,1
relationships,"She has a history of being extremely over the top, and in our most recent argument she verbally abused me just for because I was upset that she broke my trust by telling my personal details to someone I didn't know.",1
relationships,"She did apologize a good day later, but only very vaguely about using cuss words and in a ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" kind of sense.",0
relationships,"I'm guessing a traditional ""we need to talk, it's just not working out"" approach would just end up with her blowing up again, and since all my past relationships ended very amicably I'm not sure what to expect.",0
relationships,"Because she can be incredibly toxic, I've considered just blocking her and essentially ""ghosting,"" but I also feel like that would be very rude and she'd at least deserve an explanation.",1
relationships,How do I break up with her without having her potentially flipping out at me?,1
relationships,It’s gotten to the point where I feel like Tom is completely controlling me in the effort to “protect” me.,1
relationships,He won’t let me go anywhere without him and when he is forced to leave me he calls me every half hour and panics and comes home if I don’t answer (I don’t purposefully not answer- occasionally I am napping or studying).,1
relationships,I understand that the events were traumatic for Tom.,0
relationships,I recognize that every time I go to a follow up medical appointment he is frightened.,0
relationships,I understand that the fact that I still take medication scares him.,0
relationships,But I was feeling more and more lonely... like I couldn't trust or rely on her.,1
relationships,It was tearing me to pieces and I was always anxious.,1
relationships,"Finally, after a breakdown I had on christmas over my fears and the lack of help from my partner in healing from this, she broke up with me.",1
relationships,I went home the next day and we haven't spoken since.,0
relationships,I've been devastated.,1
relationships,"Therefore, it should probably come as no surprise that I sprung the question of ""What exactly are we doing here?"".",0
relationships,"Well, that backfired, as he alluded to the fact he was too freshly out of a long term relationship and didn't want to commit yet (Jason had been single for more than a year and it was a 3 year relationship).",0
relationships,"I bit my tongue until it bled and told him that was okay because we had more friends in common by that point, despite saying I needed some direct space for a few weeks or more.",0
relationships,"Unfortunately, what followed could have not been more violent.",0
relationships,"Not the type of physical violence, but emotional tension and turmoil fueled by running into each other at social settings and by alcohol.",1
relationships,"With all of this garbage happening to me, I find it hard to keep my chin up and to not be negative.",1
relationships,"By anticipating the worst and vocalizing it, I feel as though I have a better chance of avoiding the worst, because I'm still suffering (making myself unlikable or making a fool of myself).",1
relationships,"Additionally, if the situation turns out better than expected, I will be pleasantly surprised, and not let down when something goes wrong.",0
relationships,"Because of this, my relationship with my family is horrible as well.",1
relationships,"I don't want to lose one of my few friends over this, but I have no idea how to change or if such a thing is even possible.",1
relationships,I got upset and called the dogs in and closed the door.,1
relationships,When he came in he avoided me at first and when I confronted him about lying and sneaking around he defended it by saying it's my fault that I'm not okay with it.,1
relationships,I've never been okay with it and i feel like I've been lead on throughout this entire relationship.,0
relationships,The fact that he would prioritizing getting high over comforting me really hurts my feelings.,1
relationships,I'm tired of feeling like a plant is more important then me.,1
relationships,I'm trying to figure out what I learned that is good from it.,0
relationships,"but all I can think of is that I learned no one can be trusted including myself, people are inconsistent and unstable, people don't know themselves, if love exists then it doesn't mean much, and even if you truly believe that someone else cares about you and wants you in their life to the point where you finally don't question it, they can cut you off and start treating you like you're worthless without a moment's notice.",1
relationships,"the more I process what happened the more I realize there is truly no hope for me finding the kind of relationship I hope for, and there is really nothing else worth living for besides that.",1
relationships,"so, fun stuff.",0
relationships,right?,0
relationships,I'm gonna try and keep this as short as possible> We met 6 months ago and it was instant chemistry.,0
relationships,We fell in love pretty quickly and we used to talk all the time about how surprised we were at our feelings and how we had never felt like this before.,0
relationships,"Anyway a month ago he started calling less, he would still drive the few hours to come and see me but the communication between us seeing each other was lacklustre.",0
relationships,I'm not usually clingy but we used to talk on the phone several times a day.,0
relationships,this turned into a 5 minute call.,0
relationships,"But, for now, and until I'm on the proper road to recovery, I just feel no need to have sex and it worries me more than anything.",1
relationships,"He says sex is natural and in-the-moment, but I find myself having to plan everything down to what to say and do in advance.",0
relationships,Sex just doesn't come naturally to me.,0
relationships,"This has been posing a major threat to my sexual identity, and I fear if I initiate tomorrow I'll just burst into tears in the middle of it all.",1
relationships,"I'm so, so scared.",1
relationships,"I don't ""feel"" in this anymore, but I honestly can't tell if I just can't let bygones be bygones or if I'm looking at this objectively.",0
relationships,"If I do break it off, it's going to crush her personally AND add the awkwardness of her telling her friends and family its off.",1
relationships,"So I don't want to do it unless it's you know, really what's needed.",0
relationships,"And if I do leave, how do I mitigate someone who has threatened suicide at the action of me leaving?",1
relationships,**edit**: Thanks everyone.,0
relationships,I am not even sure what to say.,1
relationships,"My girlfriend was really, really mad.",1
relationships,"Not at my family, they're just basing this off what they hear, but at my sister.",1
relationships,"And honestly, I am really mad too.",1
relationships,What the fuck could she be saying about me?,1
relationships,"Perhaps as a result I feel awful about wanting more from him, I feel like it's incredibly ungrateful of me because he does do so much good for me and is really good to me in so many ways.",1
relationships,Especially with my depression and stuff he deals with a lot of household stuff in addition to working way more than I do.,0
relationships,I feel like shit for writing this post.,1
relationships,"**TL;DR - SO of over a decade is great to me in many ways and shit to me in other ways, I feel awful when he's shit to me but also feel guilty as fuck about expressing it because of all the times he's amazing to me.",0
relationships,"Wondering if this is emotional abuse and if it is, what can I do about it?",1
relationships,I also get really painful cramps/periods every month.,0
relationships,"I do not share this with the people I work with because I do not want to ""complain"" nor do I think it is any of their business!",1
relationships,"Today, I asked to leave at lunch time, because I was in a lot of pain, I had terrible cramps, and actually bled through my pants!",1
relationships,Embarrassing!,0
relationships,The secretary told me it was no problem.,0
relationships,I need help.,0
relationships,My partner's house is a mess.,1
relationships,"That is an understatement, he has over 60 empty beverage containers on his coffee table, he has over 30 fruit flies flying around, and the odour is disgusting.",1
relationships,"I don't know what to do, it's getting harder and harder for me to go over there.",1
relationships,"It worries me because I am a clean person, everything has it's spot.",0
relationships,"I’m very concerned that I might never be able to put a condom on, last in bed or satisfy a woman with my penis.",1
relationships,The girl was very satisfied and even exhausted and she said that it was the most times she cums in one night and that the previous guys just stuck it in and thrusted ( which I’m secretly jealous honestly since I’m concerned that I might not be able to stick it in right now).,0
relationships,she keeps texting me now about meeting up again.,0
relationships,She said I’m great with my hands and I’m a great kisser but she kept silent about my penis which I was apparently very bed using it.,0
relationships,I kept my cool throughout the night and laughed it off and she was very cool and said that she was expecting it but I’m very concerned that I might have a deformity or something.,0
relationships,For some reason the niece decided to call us and basically tattle on the ex for how she was living drugs etc..... we kinda already know her situation.,1
relationships,We have custody so it's not a huge deal.,0
relationships,"Well, he invited the niece we will call her Carla  and her bf to our home for a bbq.",0
relationships,"Well, they never left, I don't even understand how it happened but it did .",0
relationships,"Well,  after major issues with the bf we finally were able to get rid of him.",0
relationships,I told him I’m not using that on my makeup and my contacts stuff!,0
relationships,I’m crying and yelling and he is yelling at me and shoving a broom in my face and I just tell him I’m taking all my stuff out of the bathroom so now it’s on the shelves that I just cleared off.,1
relationships,So >now the only thing of mine in the bathroom is my toothbrush and tooth paste.,0
relationships,&nbsp; >I can’t live like this.I can’t be here anymore.,1
relationships,"I was feeling sick, I had work to do, I was tired, and all I could do was shout that I didn't want to be so close to the next step and get slingshotted back because of something I didn't know was coming.",1
relationships,I know it's my fault.,1
relationships,"I know I should've been more careful, been more prepared.",1
relationships,But I can't do this.,1
relationships,"My boyfriend has been begging me to keep the baby, and it makes me feel torn.",1
relationships,My boyfriend is currently stationed overseas while I’m still in the states with my four year old and our seven month old.,0
relationships,"It has been very hard for both of us, but I at least have the kids.",1
relationships,I often feel guilty for feeling sad or lonely because he doesn’t have anyone there.,1
relationships,"No friends (yet), family, and he misses our son terribly.",0
relationships,He’s having a really rough time with missing all of the milestones of babies first year and is depressed often... when he’s sad he gets angry.,0
relationships,There became two sides of me I battled within myself.,0
relationships,"On one hand, I wanted us to build a life together, to experience that love and the relationship.",0
relationships,I did most days.,0
relationships,"On the other, I wanted to absolve myself.",0
relationships,I obsessed with it.,0
relationships,The problem is that she won't accept the fact that I want to break up.,1
relationships,She says I'm not giving a good enough reason.,0
relationships,And she wants me to keep talking to her because I'm her only good friend that she can talk to and thinks she can win me back.,0
relationships,"I'm a pretty nice guy, and I feel bad for her because I know she struggles with making friends, and I feel like an ass if I just leave her.",1
relationships,Help me reason with myself that this is a good idea to leave her and stop communication.,1
relationships,"If you haven't outgrown that by your early 20s, I think there's possibly a problem.",0
relationships,"She thinks these comment wars she gets into are funny, and turning people's words around on them and baiting them is her idea of having fun.",0
relationships,She's delighted when someone gets mad at her.,0
relationships,I don't see how this can be fun to anyone unless they have a teenager's mindset.,0
relationships,"She does this on Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook mainly.",0
relationships,"Fast forward to 3 am, I am tired and would rather just leave, even though we have convenient seats in a standing room only club and my wife is enjoying herself.",0
relationships,"She makes a passing comment that she would likely be more comfortable at home, eating food.",0
relationships,"I jump on this and say we should walk back even though it is a 45-minute walk, in heels, in the rain (which I did not check for).",0
relationships,"She agrees we leave, she slips and falls, I did not help her up, and we fight the entire way home, divorce comes up several times.",0
relationships,This morning she won't get out of bed and won't talk to me.,1
relationships,"For context, I'm working through my last year of grad school, living alone currently with not many strong friendships in the area, and my Dad has been dying of cancer since September, so it's a stressful and lonely time.",0
relationships,"At first, I was quite excited about getting married.",0
relationships,"But for the last 3 months or so, all it does is fill me with dread and worry.",1
relationships,"When I've visited her, I've found myself falling into a deep funk.",0
relationships,I often find myself wishing she would break up with me.,0
relationships,"I obsess about this in my head 24/7 and even though I try to stay positive, the truth about how I REALLY feel comes out almost every time I go out drinking with friends and I become extremely negative and sometimes cry alone.",1
relationships,My bf has told me that he is unhappy with my weight and he also hates seeing me unhappy.,1
relationships,"A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic, he loves me to death, he tells me how beautiful I am every day, he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight, he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me.",1
relationships,I am indian and he is white.,0
relationships,"I have been in the US since I was 6 and if you ever spoke with me on the phone, you would never be able to guess that I am indian.",0
relationships,"I wanted to plant a new chapter in my new city, but haven't had time to devote to making it happen yet.",0
relationships,I feel like I was the only one taking it seriously and it's dying a slow death.,1
relationships,My problem is that one of the acquaintances is giving me a lot of power play-type problems.,0
relationships,"For example, I'll request *four times* in three different mediums we use, to email contributions to an end-of-year favorites list and rather than do that, she put hers on a share drive and told others to do the same in spite of my multiple requests to email me instead for better ease of sharing.",0
relationships,Emails are met with snarky responses or half-measures which mean I still have to chase down.,0
relationships,"I feel like at this point, I'm the only one putting effort into our relationship.",0
relationships,"I've suggested taking time to ourselves so that he could think things through, taking a break, talking about it, meeting up (we really only can see each other on the weekends due to classes), etc.",0
relationships,"Still, the short responses.",0
relationships,He's started to not respond to me; we talk through an app that shows when the other has read the message.,0
relationships,"I know his class schedule, so I know when we can answer back (he checks his phone often).",0
relationships,"She approached me and started to say something but I interrupted saying, “If this is about my phone, I am under no obligation to share with you anything that is spoken between me and a therapist, and I do not care that this is during work, I have an emergency number to call at any time when I feel like I have to, and I felt like this was important as I don’t want to go back to the psych ward.” She stopped and just said “oh, ok sorry.” I understand that this may be a negative on my performance at work, and I may not be entirely right, but I have cut myself at work (not during work but after shift and right outside at my car) and the way I was feeling I needed emergency counseling.",1
relationships,"I have tried to have a conversation with her before about how I was feeling, but it didn’t go so well since she felt like I was being rude, so while I am open to trying again, I want to know how I should go about it again and/or should I get the manager involved?",0
relationships,Thank you for reading and I appreciate any and all responses.,0
relationships,"Three of them said ""so sorry I actually can't"" and gave some noncommittal excuse, whether that was work or school related (even though school only started up again about a week ago and midterms are far away).",0
relationships,I was disappointed but figured that it happens and I can still have fun with the three other people that are coming.,0
relationships,"Only to wake up the next day and have the other three friends text me that they couldn't come either for varying reasons and they were ""so sorry"".",0
relationships,I was so upset the entire day.,1
relationships,"I had told my mom about it and she had told me that what I didn't realize was that none of them were really my close friends, since people that are actually friends don't flake out like that, plus none of them have ever come over to my place or vice versa or done anything more than hang out every now and then.",0
relationships,I don't think I have the means of moving out.,0
relationships,"I got my review in Dec. and I was supposed to get a raise if I did well, but they gave me a bonus instead and I know I should be grateful I got anything but it wasn't what I needed and I can't get another job at the moment, nothing in the area is hiring for more than what I make at the moment.",0
relationships,But I don't know what to do with my family.,1
relationships,"Just this morning I heard my sister telling my parents, they should like her more because she is the winner and I am not.",0
relationships,"I think she was talking about jobs - she recently got hired at a private university and is making great money, has excellent benefits, and could help her get her Masters.",0
relationships,My question: how do I heal from this?,0
relationships,"As much as I wish there were a way to go back and fix my relationship with her, she deserves to heal from the damage I've done, and I have no right to ask for anything -- and so I won't.",1
relationships,Lessons I've taken away: + I will **NEVER** do anything like this again.,0
relationships,"Too much pain for someone you love, and it's very hard to reconcile internally.",1
relationships,"Given the diagnosis she refuses to take her prescribed medicine which is a cause for concern to me as when she is on a low, she tends to be very apathetic and rude in responses to conversation or ideas of things we can do.",0
relationships,We live together in a house with two other people.,0
relationships,We have our own space but the common area is shared.,0
relationships,She has expressed that she doesn't like the living situation but the fact that it is cheap and we are all locked into a lease has prevented me from making any changes.,0
relationships,After our lease is up I want to look for a place that the two of us both like but I am afraid it may be all for nothing.,0
relationships,"Please tell it to me JNMIL, I just don't know what to think any more.",1

relationships,"WARNING: Messy post, I'm really all over the place, sorry guys.",0

relationships,"Also sorry for any spelling errors, english isn't one of my talents.",0
relationships,Me and my boyfriend has been dating for over a year now.,0
relationships,I can afford it alone.,0
relationships,He just has nowhere else to go.,0
relationships,"His wages are low, he relies on me for transportation.",0
relationships,I actually have to leave my job during the day to drive him to work.,0
relationships,It is tough on me to do that.,0
relationships,"I'm upset, and the fact that I don't know whether I should be upset is making me more upset.",1
relationships,I realize there's something crazy privileged about the whole thing (parents want me to spend more money?,0
relationships,i should xpost to r/firstworldproblems!),0
relationships,"If this really is an absurd thing to worry about, sorry for making you read through this thesis but please do let me know because I'm just really confused and sad.",1
relationships,"TL;DR: Mom accuses me of not valuing the benefit of earning money because I don't like to spend it, though getting a good job is pretty much all i've been focusing on.",0
relationships,"I get where she's coming from, but only if there had been inappropriate conversation or actions on my or my ex wife's part.",1
relationships,"My ex wife and I have literally zero feelings for each other, other than friendship and concern for one another as we are our son's parents.",0
relationships,I don't know really what to do at this point.,1
relationships,Maybe someone can give me some insight?,0
relationships,---,0
relationships,My bf and I went to his parents place in Iowa over Christmas.,0
relationships,"Over the years, I have always known that his parents don't absolutely love me but I didn't realize that they actually dislike me until this time I visited them.",0
relationships,"His dad is a difficult person to begin with, which is well known by everyone and he kept making little jabs at me and insulting me.",0
relationships,"For example, he asked if I am a citizen and how long I have been one, I mentioned that I have never watched Harry Potter and he ""jokingly"" asked me if I was busy clubbing and talking to boys and doubted my upbringing, and when I was using my bfs phone, he asked me why I am using it and if I am reading his texts.",0
relationships,These are just a couple examples and there are many more.,0
relationships,But I really do enjoy being with him and don't want to break up either.,0
relationships,Am I being silly?,0
relationships,Sometimes I think I'm making this a bigger deal than it should be.,1
relationships,I get insecure about the fact that my high school boyfriend is the only one who actually asked me out on a date before we slept together.,0
relationships,"Every other guy it's always turned out the same- I come on to him, we have sex for a while and the guy maintains he wants nothing serious, then out of nowhere comes on really strong with marriage and kids talk.",0
relationships,His refusal to admit to anything though has me worried this is part of ongoing deception/cheating.,1
relationships,When he completely denies knowing anything about it I just don't know what I can do with that.,1
relationships,It feels like my options are to get over it/give him the benefit of the infinitesimal doubt or leave him over the inferred deception.,1
relationships,"I guess I have mostly just let it go but then every so often I remember about it and can't help but wonder, am I a colossal idiot, is he taking me for a ride?",0
relationships,"**Tl;dr** Found an okcupid profile for my husband, he denies knowing anything about it",0
relationships,She has been cheated on after being married and while pregnant and about to have her baby.,1
relationships,She has been gone through it and knows how it feels to be hurt and lied too and said she will never do it to anyone as she’s been through it and is the type of person that wears her heart on her sleeve.,0
relationships,I completely trust my husband but this is harder then I thought.,1
relationships,Hard because I see her messaging him everyday day as soon as she wakes up and stays talking to him on the phone too.,0
relationships,Hard because they still want to see each other.,0
relationships,**tl;dr: My BF has a dirty house.,0
relationships,Never cleans his private room or bathroom even if I've told him to.,0

relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Girlfriend's violent, crazy ex-fiance is out of jail after beating up his grandparents, and I don't feel safe.",1
relationships,What do I do?,0
relationships,But now it seems like contact is gonna be forced on me.,0
relationships,"About two weeks after the breakup, she reached out to tell me she'd gotten an interview at my company.",0
relationships,We both work in a pretty specific industry and there was always some overlap with our jobs.,0
relationships,"Apparently, my company wants to put her company out of business.",0
relationships,Recruiters have poached a few folks from her work and I guess she was next on the list.,0
relationships,I felt horrible for her.,1
relationships,"Ever since, I’ve been close friends with Corrine.",0
relationships,"She told me a lot about what happened with her family, and we had a lot of late night conversations where she told me about how she had these nightmares of what might’ve happened, how she had bits of her brother’s brain on her shoes afterwards, how she tracked blood through the house while she went to get the phone to call 911.",0
relationships,I felt so awful.,1
relationships,"We were close, but I knew her past was traumatic and rarely pried.",0
relationships,How should I feel after all this?,1
relationships,"Because I feel like I was used and treated poorly, which she rejects.",1
relationships,Also how should I read into her getting annoyed about me being with other girls?,1
relationships,"If they break up again (this is their 3rd attempt at making their relationship work), should I be there in the same way ago?",0

relationships,What do I next?,0
relationships,**,0
relationships,After a few days I start to try to make plans with her to hang out or go out to eat even if its only for an hour or so.,0
relationships,She ends up saying no almost all of the time and I'm getting to where I don't even ask because I feel bad that she has to say no.,1
relationships,And this leads to me feeling lonely and unwanted.,1
relationships,The part of this that doesn't feel fair is that she can ask to do something with me at anytime and I basically drop everything to go do whatever she wants.,1
relationships,I say yes to literally every thing she asks because I just cant help myself not to.,0
relationships,"My brother and I usually get along but for some reason, he makes me really angry, to the point that I don't like who I become.",0
relationships,I'm a pretty level-headed guy and never really yell or get angry at anyone but for some reason **when it comes to my brother the anger I get is so overwhelming**.,0
relationships,He's the only one that can get me to that point of anger where I start sweating and shaking.,1
relationships,"He's never ""hurt"" me in a major way before and all the things that annoy me are little things like ignoring me, not responding to me when I talk to his lack of eye-contact and him generally ignoring/disregarding my attempts of communication.",1
relationships,I don't wanna be like this towards him and I don't really know what to do.,1
relationships,Her parents didn't know about me at this point.,0
relationships,"I kept this bottled in for a long time, but exploded and was ready to break up with her over it but she said she would stop being in touch with him.",0
relationships,She claims he has mental issues and had threatened numerous times to commit suicide.,1
relationships,"If I take her at her word, there was no sexual contact between them after we started dating.",0
relationships,This contributed to me not trusting her.,0
relationships,"Especially because Jeff drinks and does drugs, which is very inconsistent with my lifestyle.",1
relationships,Overall I regret agreeing to have him -- my bf and I have ruminated over it in couples counseling multiple times :(   ---   **tl;dr**: My boyfriend's brother is an almost college grad with very little direction.,0
relationships,My bf wants him to move to our (expensive) city with no job and live in our 50/50 shared condo rent free.,0
relationships,The only person I live with is my husband.,0
relationships,"So basically she's trying to imply that I'm mad because my husband is abusing me (which he never has), not because I'm just sick of her shit.",1

relationships,"She then said to me ""Am I not worth the effort because you don't want to fix this?""",1
relationships,after I told her I did not want to see her.,0
relationships,"There is plenty of other passive aggressive stuff that she says, but right now I'm so blinded by my disbelief I can't even tell if she is just being emotional or manipulative.",1
relationships,What bothers me is this behavior happens every time we have gotten into a fight and then I have to apologize and make it right.,1
relationships,tl;dr: Got into a fight with gf of 2 years since highschool - I've hit my breaking point.,0
relationships,I just feel really left out by someone who is supposed to be one of my best friends.,1

relationships,--- TL;DR I don't want to feel lonely anymore but I have no idea how to fix myself.,1
relationships,"I don't know why, because it didn't bother me before I actually saw it on a screen, but I am absolutely crushed.",1
relationships,"I've asked him to hide it from me from now on and expressed how hurt it was, but I went to use his gaming system a couple of days ago and saw he was still looking it up regularly (I guess he thought I wouldn't use it - I had gone to look up something and all the searches popped up in the Bing bar).",0
relationships,I never felt attractive to him and I know that's my own fault and insecurity and not his problem to fix.,1
relationships,I know rationally that men like variety.,0
relationships,But I haven't sent him nudes in probably two months now.,0

relationships,I took care of the baby all by myself for 6 months.,0
relationships,I tried to break up with him at the end of the semester the day he was supposed to leave but he intentionally missed his flight to stay talking to me and talk me into staying with him.,0
relationships,I don't know what to do.,1
relationships,"Mostly, I am scared that I will deal some kind of huge blow to his mental health and am just very scared of the repurcussions.",1
relationships,"I have friends apart from him I feel like I can fall back on, but I feel like a monster for confirming his fear of abandonment.",1
relationships,I also feel conflicted because he is incredibly kind and generous and affectionate,1
relationships,Am I being way overdramatic?,1
relationships,Hope I provided enough information.,0
relationships,I truly tried not to sound angry or overly upset.,0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: My mother has hit me quite a few times, put my clothes in trash bags when I don't clean them on time, won't let me lock my door, and has threatened to take away the car I drive that they paid for (and therefore job and access to classes).",1
relationships,I've been thinking about this for weeks and have talked about it with her on numeral occasions and I feel like I'm losing my mind.,1

relationships,I grew up my country’s equivalent of the bible belt.,0

relationships,"I grew up in an abusive household, surrounded by really misogynist men, and have experienced trauma on both these fronts.",1
relationships,This obviously caused me some mental health issues.,0
relationships,"I was afraid of, and uncomfortable around, men for a very long time.",0
relationships,It honestly felt like someone punched a hole right through me.,1
relationships,Later in the day I texted her and we talked.,0
relationships,I asked her how the trip went.,0
relationships,She sounded exited to talk to me and it sounded like it would work out between us.,0
relationships,I asked her abut her friend and if anything had happened between them and she said that nothing had happened and that her aunt was with her the whole time.,0
relationships,There is a time difference and he's busy!,0

relationships,"I, too, am loyal to her.",0
relationships,My insecurity came out pretty early in our relationship.,0
relationships,I was still getting to know her and there was a lot to figure out.,0
relationships,"It's normal to be insecure in a new relationship, but the problem is that I can't stop being insecure.",1

relationships,"Also, he's trying to set me up with his best friend [19 M], and I don't know what to do about that.",1
relationships,Thanks to anyone who may be able to offer some advice.,0
relationships,"It was worse than that, I wanted to throw up, not because I found the scars disgusting but because the person I loved so so much, had done that to herself.",1

relationships,"Her mom is her best friend in the world, but she too suffers from depression and anorexia.",0

relationships,I feel so ashamed.,1
relationships,I want to hear your opinion on the fact am i to blame?,0
relationships,Was it my fault because something like this happened?,1
relationships,**tl;dr**: Something delicate happened between me and my collegue,0
relationships,and now it's like he did a complete 180 and decided that I have to do exactly what he wants.,1
relationships,"I'm sure that he is worried about his children going wild as young adults like he did, which is fair, but frankly, I've always been very responsible with money, drinking, and just about everything else.",0
relationships,I've always been told that I'm mature for my age and have never been anything near a problem child.,0
relationships,"I really don't think there's any cause for him to worry so much about me, and I'm terrified of standing up  to him because, frankly, he does stuff like take my phone away or monitor my spending, so I don't feel safe standing up to him.",1
relationships,I obviously can't go along with this forever.,0
relationships,"He's not seeing a therapist or psych regularly, which we agreed that he needed to be doing if he was going off his meds.",0
relationships,"I'm just at this weird point with myself where I'm holding back this resentment and anger at him for not taking care of himself, even after I've explained to him how much it stresses me out and hurts me when he is not consistent with his self care and/or medication.",1
relationships,"Though things are as normal as they can be right now, I find myself getting angry when he asks me to promise to do specific things for him, like do my laundry (I'm a bit of a mess), because it just reminds me of how he wouldn't keep that promise yet he expects me to do things for him (even though they are rational requests I should take care of anyway).",1
relationships,"Well it still ended up being long, my apologies!",0
relationships,What should I even do from here?,0
relationships,Example 2.,0
relationships,"There was this life goal we had together and I happened to accomplish it much quicker than she did, but instead of being happy for me she would get super jealous and make me feel like shit for it.",0
relationships,Even though I helped her in every possible way to accomplish that goal too.,0

relationships,**tl;dr**: Girlfriend cheated on me twice.,1
relationships,Is always adamant about keeping contact with the people she cheated with.,1
relationships,The relationship is at its wits end.,1
relationships,p.s.,0
relationships,I’m just really scared about this entire situation and feel conflicted about what to do.,1
relationships,This isn’t the first time something like this has happened as my dad has previous jail records and he’s threatened our family before and even hit us when we were smaller.,1
relationships,I just feel really scared and really confused about everything and can’t believe it’s come to this.,1
relationships,"My mom doesn’t want us to do anything because she lives in fear and is hoping to wait until I graduate (I’m in 11th grade so we would have to wait a year and we really can’t/shouldn’t) so she can divorce him, she only wants to wait because she can’t support us by herself.",0
relationships,"If we do move I would be fine with getting a full-time job to support my family, I’m already a private tutor but I only do 1-hr a week for $20.",0
relationships,"My mother on the other hand tells me that she is doing all she can, when i explained to her about the way she dresses in front of him she blames him for not creating the opportunity to wear something nice.",0
relationships,ie not going out someplace due to him preferring to do work.,0
relationships,Listening to both sides separately have put me in a place where i am helpless and cannot do anything.,1
relationships,All i can do is withdraw into myself and think about other things to relieve myself.,1
relationships,Its basically that they dont understand each other.,0
relationships,We lived together so I spent the whole day yesterday packing up my things and crying.,0
relationships,I’m heartbroken but knowing he’s unfaithful makes it easier for me to move on because it’s his fault.,1
relationships,Not mine.,0
relationships,I don’t know if something I did drove him to find someone else but I know I didn’t deserve to get cheated on.,1
relationships,"Anyways, he doesn’t know that I found out and I’m planning to simply move out without a trace.",0
relationships,"I don't know whether to confront him or to move on, or is it just like that saying ""Friends are like walls.",1
relationships,"Sometimes you lean on them, and sometimes it's enough just to know they are there.""",0

relationships,"I tried to tell her what I was changing and why, but she just shrugged it off and started to fall asleep.",0
relationships,It really bothered me because I was genuinely trying to help her.,1

relationships,We have both had multiple jobs and written many drafts of resumes and cover letters.,0
relationships,I thought that sounded fun so I agreed.,0
relationships,The whole way there I was so nervous and anxious.,0
relationships,And during was kind of fine but I was fairly scared.,0
relationships,it ended up with my friend also having sex with me and I agreed but I was so wasted.,0
relationships,Afterwards I felt so sick and repulsed and freaked out by what had happened.,1
relationships,I check my phone even though I know she won't reply.,0
relationships,How do I get past this?,1
relationships,Where did I go wrong?,0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: sent my friend a love letter, basically, and she never responded and then proceeded to block me on everything.",1
relationships,"I'm aware I have problems when it comes to dating, I get jealous, paranoid and suspicious very easily.",0
relationships,I hate it about myself and hide it from my boyfriend very well.,0
relationships,"Take for example my bf, we have each other on snapchat, we maybe send one or two to each other a day it's not like a thing we do but it could be, I tried to send him more but it wasn't reciprocated.",0
relationships,Yet I always see his snapchat score go up by like 30 or more at a time (I know I shouldn't snoop it just feeds my problems but I can't help it).,0
relationships,"Anyway I just get jealous that he snaps loads to other people but not me, I don't know who.. it could be another girl.. he never sends a face pic to me but is he to others and if so why not me?",0
relationships,"Things my boyfriend does make me feel bad sometimes (for no reason actually), like when he doesn´t text me back for a few hours ( because he´s really busy with work but he texts me back whenever he can, I know it ) and I start having weird thoughts, like ""Is he already tired or bored of me?",1
relationships,"Is this just another guy who made me fall in love with him and think that he loves me and cares about me, and he actually doesn´t give a damn about me?""",0
relationships,"I don´t want to have these thoughts, so I try to stop myself from thinking about that all, but sometimes I just can´t stop and I feel too bad ( for no real reason actually because I honestly feel like he loves me a lot.",0
relationships,).,0
relationships,"I feel like a bad anxiety attack is coming, and I can´t stop it.",1
relationships,"Even if that's true (and I believe her), I hate it.",1

relationships,She says I have no reason to be jealous of him and that she's VERY happy with me and that I'm overreacting.,1
relationships,I'm not trying to create a problem when there isn't one but I feel like I have a point?,0
relationships,"I never want to tell her to stop talking to a friend, but their history makes me uncomfortable.",1
relationships,I spoke with her after all was said and done and asked why.,0
relationships,"Reasons she gave me were that I didn't do enough housework and she felt underappreciated for the work she did, that my libido is considerably higher that hers and it made her feel inadequate so she went outside the marriage to feel more like she could satisfy a person's sex drive, and that I'm boring and the newness of everything was gone.",0
relationships,"Now I'm here picking up the pieces and trying to decide if I can learn to trust her again, if I'm willing to put in the work, and what I could have done to be a better husband to avoid this.",1
relationships,I'm embarrassed and ashamed that I couldn't even hold a marriage together for 6 months.,1
relationships,"Currently she's sick because she also has untreated lupus and the stress of all of this has caused her immune system to weaken, her joints to swell, and her muscles to ache.",1
relationships,They have lives outside the group and are often coming from far away to go to this group.,0
relationships,Should I try and be friends with them?,0
relationships,"I feel like they're not going to want to hang out with a dorky 23 year old, and I have no idea what we'd even do anyway.",1
relationships,I also tried Bumble BFF to make friends but found the constant swiping and texting to be really boring and depressing.,0
relationships,There's only so much bland small talk a person can make.,0
relationships,Do I ask the boss (who’s like family to me) to not bring him back once our coming winter layoff is over?,0
relationships,How do I continue to stay sane while seeing this guy who is abusive to my extended family and completely absent with my immediate family while telling our friends he’s a happy uncle?,1
relationships,---   **tl;dr**: SO's brother works with me.,0
relationships,He is abusive to SO and her family and won't acknowledge pregnancy.,1
relationships,I [F18] have been with one guy [M21] for 3 years and within the last 4-5 months I’ve wanted to change our relationship dynamic from serious to casual.,0
relationships,"I still think I love him, but I find myself thinking about other people more and part of myself wants to see if I can do better.",0
relationships,We get along great but I’ve always felt that our relationship has lacked an emotional aspect on his part.,0
relationships,Part of the reason I want to end it also has to do with our financial situation - we’re both broke but I want to start working more to save more money because I’m trying to be more financially independent.,0
relationships,I feel like he is somehow holding me back from my personal goals.,1
relationships,It is emotionally and physically taxing for us all to deal with these.,1
relationships,I am worried that one day someone might snap and she may become injured.,0
relationships,I don’t know what to do anymore.,1
relationships,**tldr: younger sister has horrible rage fits all the time and I’m worried about our family** edit: should have specified that we have had her since she was 1 day old,1
relationships,I broke up with my bf of 2.5 yrs on Sunday after suspecting he was the reason why I had fallen into depression for the past year or so.,0
relationships,"I became more irritable, rude, negative and angry... which was not like my usual positive, polite, and bubbly self.",0
relationships,"He was often very negative, had anger issues/tantrums, impatient, interrupted me a lot, would ditch me for cocaine, didn't know how to drink alcohol (often consumes until he pukes), was a hypochondriac, always broke (yet had money for weed/shatter or sports betting or junk food or alcohol...), but at the same time did not look after his own health unless I pushed him to... just a lot of care-taking and issues.",1
relationships,He has depression and anxiety as well.,0
relationships,One of the things that really killed me inside about him was his last girlfriend who had died in a car crash about 1 year before he met me.,0
relationships,"As mentioned above, my girlfriends gets pissed off when I act uninterested in her friends and starts accusing me of hating them, which is ridiculous because I hardly even know them, and she gets really upset and stops talking to me for awhile.",1
relationships,"I'm starting to think that it's gonna end up being a choice between me or her friends and so far, I'm losing.",1
relationships,TL;DR: My girlfriend's friends are annoying as fuck and I'm not very fond of them.,0
relationships,"I don't ever say anything negative about them, yet my girlfriend still gets pissed off if I don't praise them.",1
relationships,All our arguments are about them.,0
relationships,"So I don't believe she's telling me the real reason shes pressuring me to have another baby I am going to leave it here, please ask, I made a fake account so I can be honest as possible.",0
relationships,Here are my primary concerns though 1) The day care incident with money.,1
relationships,I feel like I cant trust her with finances.,1
relationships,Kind of starting to worry that I’m doing something really wrong.,1
relationships,Now I’m wondering if I should even attempt talking to him anymore or if I should just block him and move on.,1
relationships,What would you do in this situation?,0
relationships,---   **tl;dr**: I think I’m getting ghosted by the guy I like and now idk what to do ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,1
relationships,We've been through so much.,0

relationships,"But his good qualities where he was considerate, loyal, caring, honest, gentlemanly and supportive is what makes me miss him.",0
relationships,Especially his good-bye text.,0
relationships,"I asked him how he's doing to fund this, if there are any bursaries and if so, how much these are, but he never gives a clear answer.",0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Boyfriend is unemployed, looking for 'perfect' job until he starts his Medicine degree, unsure how he will fund this degree.",0
relationships,I resent him for poor financial judgement and day-time chilling.,1
relationships,How to change this?,0
relationships,He turns it on first thing in the morning and turns it on the moment he gets home from work at night to play until midnight or later.,0
relationships,Any free moment he has is spent playing this game.,0
relationships,"I'm a stay at home mom so I really look forward to talking to him, he's usually the only adult I talk to face to face during the week.",0

relationships,"Plus, I don't know if maybe he is talking badly about me as well when I'm not there (it seems likely).",0
relationships,What can I do?,0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: Coworker who is supposed to show me the ropes is super grumpy and I find him intimidating, can I do anything about this?",1

relationships,Any advice?,0
relationships,"I come from an Asian family where kids are not expected to move out, its the opposite where kids are supposed to live at home and take care of the parents when they become adults, however living in America has made me hate this mindset because I am never able to be an individual.",0

relationships,Apparently it has been going on since the day they moved in together.,0
relationships,I don't know what to tell her thought.,1
relationships,Since her husband is a good friend of me and my husband it's kinda weird for me to say 'leave him' or 'get out' I don't want to influence any decision she makes.,0
relationships,What should I tell her?,0
relationships,Tl;dr: friends husband is aggresive and I don't know what to tell her,1

relationships,Have shared friends and can’t seem to shake the feeling of sadness/anger whenever I see her due to our reason for breaking up.,0
relationships,Should I cut her out of my life and lose friends or make more of an effort to be friendly/peaceful towards her?,1
relationships,"We've been getting along very well, and our previous repeated complaints on both sides of ceased because of this.",0
relationships,But as time has gone on my feelings have changed in regards to me thinking I can accept this and work through it with her.,0

relationships,"He tells me that I made him this way and I need to deal with it until he moves past it, which I understand and agree with.",1
relationships,"It’s almost a 50/50 mindset, because on one hand she wouldn’t ever wish to be thought of or treated in a horrid way, I have corrected it best I can, and she is the kind of person to forgive and forget.",0
relationships,It’s hard.,0
relationships,It’s real hard to decide what to do.,1
relationships,So that’s why I’m here today people of Reddit.,0
relationships,"I realize this isn’t the most pressing, serious, or dramatic post on here, but I stick my hand out in the hopes you can give me some guidance, some past experience, wisdom, or advice on what I can do or try so that the “here and now” are in question, and not “then and there”, so that my confession can go along without regret.",0

relationships,She knows I'm sexually active and I don't have a boyfriend and is really judgmental about me having casual sex.,0
relationships,I had a pregnancy scare last week (I'm not pregnant) and all I wanted was some advice from my mom and she used it as a way to make me feel bad about my sex life.,0
relationships,"When I was younger, she would constantly slut-shame me for things I hadn't even done, and made me feel so guilty about the idea of even having sex that I didn't have sex even with my year-long high school boyfriend because of this crippling guilt.",1
relationships,Whenever we argue she makes it a time to critique my entire personality and not just my behavior in that argument or even within my relationship with her.,0

relationships,"But I only want my boyfriend, he has a shy personality but he’s very knowledgeable, he’s like a walking Wikipedia and I love him so much.",0
relationships,"He makes me feel calm just laughing at our inside jokes, receiving a cute text from him, and ever since being in a relationship with him I’ve grown to be happy with the smallest things in life.",0
relationships,"But he never seems to be able to move on from the event from his past, or he‘s just deeply affected by his depression and negative thoughts, also all the stress from his studying in university and family really is a big problem.",1

relationships,"She does not see a mental health professional (because narcissist) and blames everyone else for any wrong she may do, which of course she does no wrong.",1
relationships,Should I chill out and let her contact me?,0
relationships,"---   **tl;dr**: The level of communication outside of face-to-face interaction is making it difficult to maintain attraction and to set up plans with the woman I am dating, and it has become worse the last couple weeks despite our in-person interactions being consistently great.",0
relationships,Am I being too anxious/not understanding enough or is she a bad communicator?,1
relationships,How do I bring this up with her?,0
relationships,But what do I know?,0

relationships,"How is me honestly explaining that the reason I would have to cancel on a friend because my boyfriend is sick, the same as him giving away very detailed information about our sex life plus other very personal traumas that I experienced without my permission?",1

relationships,"This is definitely true but she criticized my political opinions, my social behaviors, and my pop culture opinions in addition to just my relationship with her.",0
relationships,"She also constantly mocks me when we fight, literally repeating my words back to me in a childish/cartoony voice and putting words in my mouth.",1
relationships,She refuses to listen to my point of view.,1
relationships,We recently got into a fight where I thought a Christmas present my father had gotten me was cheaper than it was.,0
relationships,He doesn't have to spend a load of money on things I like!,0
relationships,He can use it to spend on himself.,0
relationships,"I don't understand why he feels that just because we're in a relationship that he has to ""spoil"" me.",1
relationships,"I enjoy being spoiled but only when I'm the one spoiling myself, haha.",0
relationships,TL;Dr: My boyfriend doesn't like that I don't want him to do anything for me,1
relationships,Sometimes I feel like I’m the third wheel in their relationship.,0
relationships,And this doesn’t even include what they may do when I’m not around!,0
relationships,"Also, whenever roommate will talk about boys or finding a boyfriend, I notice husband will quickly try to shut that idea down fast, and say he knows roommate isn’t attracted to said guy or doesn’t want/need a boyfriend.",0
relationships,There’s definitely an emotional dependency there.,0
relationships,I know my husband has explained to me over and over how much he helps her and how important he is in her life.,0
relationships,"I was in a rabbit hole of youtube videos over the weekend, starting off from music videos, then vine compilations, and then somehow fight videos.",0
relationships,"On one of the side videos, I noticed a video involving ""XYZ high school"" where my boyfriend attended.",0
relationships,The video was actually pretty clear and my blood kind of ran cold when I realized one of the 2 kids in the video was my boyfriend.,0
relationships,It was absolutely brutal.,1
relationships,And there's no doubt that this was him.,0
relationships,"He apologizes if I point it out later, but the first instinct is always to blame me.",0
relationships,"And often the thing he's blaming me for is exaggerated, and made to look like a routine flaw in me, even if it's a once off thing.",1
relationships,"He doesn't hesitate to show his bad mood/displeasure (which applies to how he is around most people not just me, but I think it's worse when it's about me).",0
relationships,"He doesn't hide it at all even if we're around other people, so I have to be particularly cautious not to piss him off or bring up anything that could upset him in public.",0
relationships,"When he's upset/displeased in private, he withdraws and it's up to me to grovel and convince him to talk to me again.",1
relationships,"Even when she hated me, I didn't hate her.",0
relationships,"There weren't enough good friends in my life for me to afford hating her, and there still aren't.",0
relationships,I can't describe it.,0
relationships,"She and my mom were chatting at dinner (they're the talkers of the family), and the whole time, I was just glaring at her.",0
relationships,"She tried talking to me, and I felt my entire body physically tense, and I was just viscerally angry.",1
relationships,"But then I'll get there and he'll drop the bomb that his GF is coming over and to be honest, it totally makes me want to bail early.",0
relationships,"It's just annoying to be invited to come over and thinking you're gonna have some bro time gaming and what not, only to get there have him drop the bomb that his GF is coming over and being stuck between either listening to 5th grade cheesy/cringeworthy convos or figuring a way to bail early without coming across as an asshole.",1
relationships,"How can I talk with my buddy in a polite way about the matter, that when he invites me over I'd prefer it to be bro time without coming across as an asshole or that I'm against his GF as a person which I'm totally not!",0
relationships,"Again, she's really sweet and he has every right to want his GF to come over to, I'm just tired of the surprise third wheel through the most goose bump inducing conversations and want some strategies how I can communicate with my friend that I don't like sitting through that.",1
relationships,Thanks in advance!,0
