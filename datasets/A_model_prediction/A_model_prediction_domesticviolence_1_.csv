domesticviolence,"Like, for one example *""...that time I called you from jail, and you cried b/c you were at a guys house and you knew what you did was wrong so you told me you needed help...""* yet he won't show me any evidence (it doesn't exist)...",0
domesticviolence,He's literally fabricating things out of thin air and claiming they happened.,1

domesticviolence,If I hadn’t have grabbed my toddlers head and pressed it against mine and ducked it would have hit us both.,1
domesticviolence,I was yelled at so much I could see the veins bulging in his neck as he swore at me and called me names.,1
domesticviolence,I held my hands over the children’s ears so they couldn’t hear.,0

domesticviolence,"I don't know if I'm able to do that, since I didn't tell the doctor the truth to begin with.",0
domesticviolence,"I will say that my doctor very clearly didn't believe me at my follow up appointment, but my bf was in the waiting room.",0
domesticviolence,So I didn't admit to anything.,0
domesticviolence,"I was teary eyed, however.",0
domesticviolence,From anyone's experience- is it worth it to go to the police?,0
domesticviolence,at some point they laughed and i had to leave because i got physically sick to my stomach.,1

domesticviolence,If I keep gambling he could permanently damage me.,1
domesticviolence,I'm in healthcare I know these numbers so WHY?,0

domesticviolence,"Now that chokings are happening during every incident, the accidents could be irreversible.",0
domesticviolence,We ate and he was monitoring my data use because I sent some photos to our friend of her baby shower.,0
domesticviolence,"And he said he ""hates having to watch over me like a father and he wishes I was more responsible"" but said that he ""accepts that this is the way I am"" I said nothing in response to this and just ate my food and let it slide, smiled at him and small talked.",0
domesticviolence,We got back to the park and they had put out a new sign saying they were closed for the rest of the day.,0

domesticviolence,I even pressed chargers against him.,0
domesticviolence,Unfortunately he still found a way through to me by hooking up with girls that I know and having them make sure I knew about it.,0
domesticviolence,Nothing has happened since June and I’m about to be moving far away from him.,1
domesticviolence,I struggle with what he did to me every day and the flashbacks occur still.,1
domesticviolence,I don’t expect this to ever fully go away but I am 18 now and I can say that I survived this.,0
domesticviolence,"I've told her each time to stop, she apologised but doesn't see what the big deal is because she ""hasn't been in love with me for a long time.""",1

domesticviolence,I just feel terrible.,1
domesticviolence,I can barely get out of bed to go to uni.,1
domesticviolence,So now they are querying whether he has a traumatic brain injury suffered a year before we got together and that now he has progressing brain damage.,0
domesticviolence,"At this point my nurse self kicks in, I can't not help someone in that situation.",0
domesticviolence,I feel sorry for him I don't want him to be hurt or alone.,1
domesticviolence,But I also want to hate him and leave.,1
domesticviolence,So my incredibly long winded question to you is this: if he has brain damage is this an excuse or a reason?,0
domesticviolence,"So a bit of long back story here, I was adopted as a child not a proper legal adoption, there was a residency order for me to live with my aunt and uncle for an underdetermined amount of time, after a year my aunt and uncle split and my uncle kept me (my aunt was the one I was actually related to) social services never really got involved past this point.",0
domesticviolence,"My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer.",0
domesticviolence,"My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill, I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.",1
domesticviolence,He would play really loud music on the speaker.,0
domesticviolence,It got so bad when he threw the living room table at me.. we got kicked out of at least 4 apartments.,1
domesticviolence,At this point we were homeless.,0
domesticviolence,"He wouldn’t get a job, and wanted me to get out and hold a sign and pan handle for money, if I didn’t he would drive the car we lived in really fast and say he was going to kill us.",1
domesticviolence,He wrecked that car (small wrecks) at least ten times.,0
domesticviolence,"The husband's voice sounds like pure rage, the wife's both angry and defensive.",0
domesticviolence,A couple of times there were sounds of broken objects.,0
domesticviolence,"We have never really talked (they don't speak good English), so I'm not sure how to approach them about it.",0
domesticviolence,"Calling the police feels excessive, but I'm also worried someone might be abused.",1
domesticviolence,What is an appropriate thing to do here?,0
domesticviolence,"I knew that he was scary when he would pray in front of me, yet the entire thing was an angry ATTACK on God (not trying to get into beliefs here, just what happened.)",0
domesticviolence,"I knew he knew how wrong he was when he told me one day to not tell anyone but that he actually HAD threatened suicide in front of his ex wife with a knife, yet still painted her as the evil doer in the story.",0
domesticviolence,I knew he was lying when he made sure to tell me about how crazy one of his exes went at the end accusing him of rape (why would he even bring it up!!),0
domesticviolence,"and how after he took another ex home from injury while we were together, that she might try to lie to me and say that something happened, but NOTHING did!",0
domesticviolence,"It gave me chills when this man would tell me if his ex wasn't his child's mother he would have had her murdered long ago, and that he had friends offer to help!",1
domesticviolence,Extra: Apparently he was jailed before marrying my mom and he never told us until she found out later into the marriage.,0
domesticviolence,There's more into the story but I would like to know if I can file a charge on him for past incidents as well.... and I am upset that he is going to be charged for misdeamenor instead of felony.,1
domesticviolence,"Since the victim (my mom) has enough evidences, it will be hard for him to drop the charges right?",0
domesticviolence,He has been avoiding the police so it took a while for the police to catch him but he paid for the bail and bailed himself out with a help of his friend.,0
domesticviolence,I just wished he would recieve a felony but he pleaded not guilty on the first court appearance and apparently there are more court appearances to be made befoe verdict is finalized....,0

domesticviolence,We had a child together.,0
domesticviolence,"After she was born, I made my way out.",0
domesticviolence,I ended up fleeing several houses and apartments trying to stay away from him.,0

domesticviolence,I mean what are you suppose to do when your son is 5 and his older brother who is 16 is picking on him.,0
domesticviolence,He was too big for them to punish.,0
domesticviolence,"So I endured it , some days I hate my whole family for never saying anything.",1
domesticviolence,They just were okay with me being scared of my brother constantly.,0
domesticviolence,Fast forward to me being 18 living with my other brother.,0
domesticviolence,He wouldn't take me to the hospital but I could feel the gaping wound in the back of my head and the hole in my lip my tooth had done.,0
domesticviolence,He kept packing.,0
domesticviolence,So I called the police.,0
domesticviolence,I couldn't see out of my left eye and clearly couldn't drive and felt I had no other option.,1
domesticviolence,The police department chose not to press charges.,0
domesticviolence,If they weren't done he would get angry at her.,1
domesticviolence,After that he would borrow money from her while he was making a lot of money.,0
domesticviolence,"Instead of paying her back, he would spend both his income and her money on things he wanted.",0
domesticviolence,"The next thing was that he would say things like ""I'll do this for you but you'll owe me a blow job later.""",0
domesticviolence,While that worried me the next sign really made me concerned.,1

domesticviolence,He causes emotional pain to me every day but I cannot get myself to leave him.,1
domesticviolence,He physically abuses me sometimes but it rarely leaves a mark or bruise.,0
domesticviolence,I feel like even if he cheats on me (again) I still won’t want to leave him.,1
domesticviolence,The only way I think I will leave him forever is if I end up hating him.,1
domesticviolence,And the only way I will hate him is if he caused physical harm that I cannot lie my way out of like I have in the past.,1
domesticviolence,"""I understand as a woman why you are doing this.",1
domesticviolence,"But as a mother, I am begging you not to press charges.",0
domesticviolence,It will ruin his life.,0
domesticviolence,"Please, let us take care of him.",0
domesticviolence,We'll set him straight.,0
domesticviolence,- kicked me out of the house and was going to make me leave in the middle of the night multiple times while insulting me and hitting me I'm sorry to even post this here but I need a little support right now.,1
domesticviolence,He said this to me two nights ago and came into our guest bedroom where I was sleeping the next day and said sorry Kind of.,0
domesticviolence,I tried to talk to him about it and he said he was under a lot of stress and that he doesn't need my love or support and he doesn't want to talk about it.,0

domesticviolence,I’m actually pretty terrified of him now.,1
domesticviolence,He also once brought explosives to my brothers house and claimed he “forgot they were there”.. none of my family or our friends growing up believed me when I told them about him.,0
domesticviolence,Which is why I can’t talk to anyone.,0
domesticviolence,"I feel sad for you, I feel sad for me.",1
domesticviolence,"I pray that you will get the help you so desperately need so that nobody else has to endure the terror and horrible horrible physical, sexual, and emotional abuse you have put me through.",1
domesticviolence,I am riding myself of all my shame associated with what has happened.,1
domesticviolence,"I know now, it was all you.",0
domesticviolence,I did not do anything wrong to deserve the horrible treatment I received from you.,1
domesticviolence,It feels as if no one understands what I’m going through in my life because I took a while to leave and didn’t tell anyone until now.,0
domesticviolence,I really didn’t think it was that bad.,0
domesticviolence,"Now that I’m out of the situation, it still haunts me.",0

domesticviolence,"After again trying to talk to him, he ended up refusing to go, I'm still not sure why.",1
domesticviolence,"He then ignored me for days again, we again briefly made up for my son's birthday, and started fighting again not long after.",0
domesticviolence,Every time I tell him to leave he threatens to harm my pets or take them and release them to the wild (I have ferrets.... they CANNOT survive in the wild where I live) or he goes into rants about how useless I am and how I couldn't survive without him and somehow he worms his way back in for fear he might be right.,1
domesticviolence,TLDR; need him out.,0
domesticviolence,He threatens animals.,0

domesticviolence,"Early on in our relationship there were a couple of events that looking back i should have treated as red flags, basically my partner reacted volcanically to some fairly normal behaviour on my part such as messaging with a female friend (actually wife of one of my old mates) and me trying to arrange to meet my friends from home for beers (i live a couple of cities away from my home town).",0
domesticviolence,I wrote this stuff off as isolated incidents and we eventially bought a place together and decided to start the family we'd both always dreamt of.,0
domesticviolence,The pregnancy was kind of a beautiful bubble of love and anticipation and i was (and still am) elated by the arrival of our little boy.,0

domesticviolence,Always ask me to massage his naked back by stepping on it almost every night.,0
domesticviolence,"Even if it's midnight, he'll make my mom wake me up, even tho I don't want to.",0
domesticviolence,But I'll comply because I was afraid to refuse as he could get quite angry if I do so.,0
domesticviolence,"I don't know what's going on inside my mom's head at that time, but I just assume that she's too powerless, too afraid of my stepdad.",0
domesticviolence,"The man who abused me, his mother is a political figure.",0
domesticviolence,I SUSPECT she is using her wealth and influence to keep her sons abuse secret.,0
domesticviolence,"The family has been blaming me for my abuse, denying it happened, threatenung me into changing my story, and generally defaming my character.",0
domesticviolence,I can't prove it but suspect this may have happened to a girl before me.,0
domesticviolence,Is there a way to expose this family?,0
domesticviolence,"And really, that's why I'm typing this post.",0
domesticviolence,"I want to know for certain if I was witnessing a domestic violence incident (feel free to delete this post if otherwise - again, this is a throwaway, so I don't mind), if there's anything I could and/or should have done differently there, and if there's anything I can do to help in case this happens again (which knowing my job, it will).",0
domesticviolence,"I'm wondering if I should have slipped her info to a hotline, or lied about calling the police, or *something* - in the back of my mind, I keep telling myself there was something I could have done here.",1
domesticviolence,Any ideas?,0
domesticviolence,"EDIT:  In case it isn't clear, I DID call the police - I just didn't inform them of my domestic violence suspicions until they arrived, due to what happened between the call and their arrival.",0
domesticviolence,He’s claiming I beat him in that fight.,0
domesticviolence,I had to go to court and be treated like I was the abuser and the whole time he sat there next to me.,1
domesticviolence,A protection order was written and I nor my daughter can go home.,0
domesticviolence,I have a 30 day to vacate of face eviction from my landlord and I lost my job over all of this.,1
domesticviolence,My pre trial is next month and my lawyer seems like he has no idea about my case.,0
domesticviolence,I feel so damaged by my childhood that I feel like I could never be fixed.,1
domesticviolence,Everything he's said is true about me.,0
domesticviolence,"I am stupid, crazy, cunt, bitch, whore, and people only want me for my body.",1
domesticviolence,I feel so ready to just go.,1
domesticviolence,I hate myself so much.,1
domesticviolence,She hangs up; told me she was going to; but she leaves.,0
domesticviolence,That was a bit frightening.,0
domesticviolence,"But I guess at that stage the police were already here, because the abuse from him starts.",0
domesticviolence,“Oh you actually called the fucking cops did you?” “Why would you call the fucking cops?” “I can’t believe you’d call the fucking cops”.,1
domesticviolence,"Three days later, I’ve just checked the phone.",0
domesticviolence,"Let alone his assault charges from beating her, RIGHT?",0
domesticviolence,"If it did, what would be her options with the issue of the lease she wouldn't be able to afford?",1
domesticviolence,I desperately want to help her with this situation.,0
domesticviolence,"I feel like if I can help her and choose not to, anything that happens to her becomes my fault.",1
domesticviolence,I refuse to let that happen.,1
domesticviolence,My husband has poor impulse control (his words) especially when he gets angry or frustrated.,0
domesticviolence,I've noticed he often will take out frustration on the dog (he's a rescue who is legitimately hard to manage).,0
domesticviolence,"He's never hit me or hit the dog, but he will often pull the leash too hard and go too far with discipline.",1
domesticviolence,"For example the other day, the dog was having a lot of anxiety and being bad and barking in the car at every dog we passed.",0
domesticviolence,When we arrived home my partner got out of the car and pulled the dogs leash so hard that he fell out the door into his back.,0
domesticviolence,"After I took care of healing my self, my biggest concern has been that he will do it again to another poor woman.",0
domesticviolence,"He is already dating someone new that is even younger than I am, I was already 13 years younger than him, and I am so worried for her that once she passes the 2 year dating mark he will repeat the pattern of abuse just as he has done in the past.",0
domesticviolence,I wish there was a way to at least give women and men the chance to know of what they are getting into ahead of time and then let them make the decision if they think the person is reformed or not before getting trapped in a potentially abusive relationship.,1
domesticviolence,It makes me sick that the pattern of abuse can continue without any transparency.,1
domesticviolence,I wish there was an online database of domestic abusers similar to sex offenders.,0
domesticviolence,The problem is that I have zero support system.,0
domesticviolence,I have a job but I couldonly afford this motel room for a week and my dog followed me on foot for a few miles until we somehow got separated.,0
domesticviolence,He ended up at someone else's home and I want him back so badly.,1
domesticviolence,I have no way to go get him and I'm scared and alone and  I'm a Christian but I need someone to tell me it's going to be ok.,1
domesticviolence,Please.,0
domesticviolence,Im so in love with my wife when she’s happy and herself.,0
domesticviolence,We have everything in common.,0
domesticviolence,But when she becomes abusive and manipulative it’s too much and she says she will change and she’s taking meds now and she booked a counselor but I don’t know if this is more manipulation and lies or if it’s real?,1
domesticviolence,I just don’t know.,1
domesticviolence,She’s had soooo many chances to do this but only after we have separated is she ever actually doing anything about it.,1
domesticviolence,Ask a local representative for help?,0
domesticviolence,What are some steps I can take that I haven't yet?,0
domesticviolence,"I'm scared, and so .... almost annoyed of dealing with this, he was served a protective order way back in October 2017.",0
domesticviolence,Also...how has he repeatedly had so much success with the police?,0
domesticviolence,"It honestly baffles me, which is why I wonder whether he's paying them off (he told me he'd done this while we were together, although that could've been a fear tactic).",1
domesticviolence,"I used to always feel I loved him more than he does with me, that was a common fight.",0
domesticviolence,And it turned out to be sickly true.,0
domesticviolence,"I care so much for that man, I place myself in his shoes and feeling the pain he must be feeling being alone.",1
domesticviolence,"I know this is sick of me, but how do I stop this?!",1
domesticviolence,I shouldn’t feel bad for what he did right?,1
domesticviolence,!,0
domesticviolence,I loved that man so much and tried my best to make it work.,0
domesticviolence,But I have limits.,0
domesticviolence,"And when he was not thinking twice about getting alcohol while we didn’t have even enough money left for milk for our baby, that was my limit.",0
domesticviolence,We had .51 cents in our account and he found that acceptable?,0
domesticviolence,!,0
domesticviolence,I find myself curious if any of you have experienced a partner who with holds sex and affection as part of their abuse pattern.,0
domesticviolence,I mostly read about men who force or otherwise guilt/manipulate their partners to have sex.,0
domesticviolence,My situation is different.,0
domesticviolence,My husband refuses to touch me.,0
domesticviolence,"If I try to initiate sex which I have done many times in the past, he will flat out push me away.",1
domesticviolence,I can't even talk about the day she left me because it was so traumatic.,1
domesticviolence,I can't even admit it to myself.,1
domesticviolence,It was awful beyond words and I can't tell anyone.,1
domesticviolence,How can I see a therapist if I'm afraid I'm going to lose my shit just opening up about that one day?,1
domesticviolence,I feel like it would ruin any progress I've made...I'm afraid I'm going to be hiding forever.,1
domesticviolence,"I won't defend myself, I know I shouldn't have raised my voice and I should have left much much earlier.",1
domesticviolence,I know who I am.,0
domesticviolence,"That said.. Every day, I see a look that tells me a person I know loathes me.",0
domesticviolence,A thin veneer of social platitudes to cover a roiling hatred.,0
domesticviolence,I don't know what to write past this point.,1
domesticviolence,I have been trying to find an answer to this question over 6 months.,0
domesticviolence,My story starts when I changed while my life for the man I loved by believing him that he loves me and moving to California from Israel.,0
domesticviolence,Since I was the one who were going to take the big step I had many concerns yet he always literally begged me to move here... finally I did move here and we got married.,0
domesticviolence,After a while I found out from a Facebook message that he has been cheating on me all those time that he was begging me to move in with him.,0
domesticviolence,I asked him about the message and he lied about it over an hour.,0
domesticviolence,"Weird title I know but I really couldn’t find any other way to describe what I’m feeling and I really struggled to think if I should post this on here or another group So for as long as I can remember I’ve always been attracted to women and only women I had absolutely no interest in men at all A few years back I had my first relationship which was really manipulative and physically abusive and I haven’t been on any dates since then Recently though (like in the last two weeks) it’s accused to me that bar an old crush from before my ex “kinda-sorta” coming back I haven’t found any women attractive at all in a while at least a year and whenever I see someone I would have normally found attractive I just get a nervous/uncomfortable feeling I can’t really describe I’m not sure if this is a response to how my ex used to get abusive if she thought I was attracted to her (like she’d insist I must want to rape her if I called her beautiful for example) and I know for a long time afterwards I felt disgusted with myself if I found someone attractive so this may just be the next step in that, like my mind doesn’t want me to feel bad for finding someone attractive so it stops finding people attractive",0
domesticviolence,He goes in the bedroom and we only have one car so he has to take me to work.,0
domesticviolence,He is just sitting on the bed and I have to be at work in literally 16 minutes (I live close to my work).,0
domesticviolence,I said come on you're going to make me late and he said well find the fucking car keys.,1
domesticviolence,So I started looking then he found them.,0
domesticviolence,Then honestly he was just going on and on and yelling at me and I tuned out what he was saying so I don't even remember.,1
domesticviolence,"This past week he's gotten really bad where he told her she couldn't use the house phone, her cell phone, the computer, the car, or even watch tv.",1
domesticviolence,He even stopped eating food that my mom makes and starting making his own for himself.,0
domesticviolence,Yesterday I atleast bought my mom a new cell phone and added her to my plan.,0
domesticviolence,He hasn't improved in the past week whatsoever.,0
domesticviolence,This was the last straw for me and I want to move out in the next 2 months and ask her to live with me temporarily.,0
domesticviolence,I don’t know what to expect.,1
domesticviolence,I just want to not be so alone.,1
domesticviolence,He is a law enforcement officer in this small town.,0
domesticviolence,I’ve been down this road with him before.,0
domesticviolence,The injuries have never been so severe though.,0
domesticviolence,"Dear reddit, For what I am about to tell you today is not a rant from a ""man"", but a voice of a concerned human being who happens to be male.",0
domesticviolence,Victims of domestic violence who are men are being laughed at and not taken seriously in today's society.,0
domesticviolence,"It seems the society has made up their mind that men could not be victims of female violence because the male is ""much bigger"", therefore the male has some kind of ""agenda"" against the female.",0
domesticviolence,I was punched and slapped in the face two weeks ago by my wife who is 5'2 103lbs.,0
domesticviolence,He came after me a few times so I got away and called cops.,0
domesticviolence,"He was arrested, restraining order in place and he also had unregistered gun and no licence for them so he may be in trouble for that also.",0
domesticviolence,"The hard part is he was good to my son, and now he is abruptly gone which is best, but I am not not sure how to explain to him.",0
domesticviolence,he is six and very sensitive and the spent a lot of time together.,0
domesticviolence,"tl;dr boyfriend got aggressive and is jailed, how to tell young son why bf is gone now and we have to move soon?",1
domesticviolence,"So I drank wine and I started crying and since my husband was constantly telling me that I ruined his life and he regrets being married to me and I'm the devil and blah blah, for the first time in my life I picked up the knife and I thought I should just kill my self.",0
domesticviolence,When my husband saw me he started screaming and snatched the knife away from me and said I am trying to get him into trouble by committing suicide.,0
domesticviolence,He kicked me and spat on me.,0
domesticviolence,I kept on try to explain to him that I can't take him blaming me for everything and he believes everything he says so hard that every works out of my mouth is a lie.,1

domesticviolence,"This is just a rumor, but our next-door neighbors say that the house is actually under police watch, and that they're drug dealers.",0
domesticviolence,"The dad is some heavily obese man who should probably invest in larger shirts, and he doesn't leave the home.",0
domesticviolence,"There are always cars coming and going from the house, sometimes the same cars, other times cars we've never seen before.",0
domesticviolence,"Ya know, to buy drugs and shit.",0
domesticviolence,He shouldn't be able to do that to anyone else.,1
domesticviolence,I'm just so scared.,1
domesticviolence,"I wasn't perfect either and I'm scared people won't believe me, or he will twist it so he's the victim and I'm the bad guy, although I know what happened was wrong and I have evidence that he knows what he did was wrong.",1
domesticviolence,"Im scared this will ruin my life, but I also can't bear the thought of him doing that to anyone else.",1
domesticviolence,If anyone needs details about what happened I can share,0
domesticviolence,"During the walk she made a lot of threats about how she was going to call the police, put me in jail, even try to get me deported (I'm a LPR.)",0
domesticviolence,She gets vindictive like this but usually calms down.,0
domesticviolence,Due to the threats I called the police to ask their advice.,0
domesticviolence,The officer wanted me to give him her information and I declined.,0
domesticviolence,"Short story, he gave me two options.",0
domesticviolence,"Even as I’m cooking, he’s still screaming in my face, telling me that I’m done at my job and I need to quit now.",1

domesticviolence,We're both military members.),0
domesticviolence,A few things have happened since last Saturday.,0
domesticviolence,"Original post here: <url> Quick update: my abusive ex, who put forward his candidacy for local council, was elected Friday by acclamation - meaning no one came forward to challenge him, so no election will be necessary, and he is automatically the winner.",0
domesticviolence,He is flush with victory at the moment.,0
domesticviolence,"I have decided to come forward anyways, about the emotional and sexual abuse that I experienced during the relationship.",0
domesticviolence,"I know I may pay a price, for speaking openly in our small community.",1
domesticviolence,"I’m in Florida, can’t find concrete laws that apartment companies will let me off lease because of abuse.",1

domesticviolence,However I coped with it.,0

domesticviolence,Even though my 3 older children have developed mental illness over the past year.,0
domesticviolence,I actually do have access to some money where I believe I could pay off at least some of what I owe but I honestly don’t even know where I can get a number for the debts that I owe.,1
domesticviolence,I am afraid to even begin for several reasons.,0
domesticviolence,"1) I am worried I might actually be in legal trouble over this, 2) I am afraid of seeking help from someone who isn’t understanding of my situation and will just be totally horrified about what a mess it is and they will be mean to me.",1
domesticviolence,Are there any counseling resources available to me?,0
domesticviolence,I am NOT looking for a handout I just need help being walked through the steps of what I need to do to resolve this.,1
domesticviolence,Then I started to notice how much of a temper he has.,1
domesticviolence,The first few weeks he was good at hiding it but it started coming out.,0
domesticviolence,He was full of compliments for me but they were pretty generic and he took me on a bunch of dates.,0
domesticviolence,The last few days I was kind of avoiding him and he kind of tried getting controlling.,0
domesticviolence,Yesterday I was going to spend Christmas eve with him and his family and I tried bringing up some major concerns about the way things were going and he flipped out and started screaming and throwing shit.,1
domesticviolence,I lost a child because of this man and i went back for round 2?,0
domesticviolence,Am I nuts?,1
domesticviolence,Why am I so surprised i've come out looking like i've just had 10 round with Tyson?,1
domesticviolence,Advice please - anyone gone through a similar experience?,0
domesticviolence,What did you do?,0
domesticviolence,He has anger issues and he seems like a good guy sometimes (even though i know he's a fucking monster) and i know he's had a bad childhood.,1
domesticviolence,It's even harder because if he does get arrested or something for it my best friend won't have anyone to support her/pay for her tuition or her meals even... her mom doesn't have the money to do that and i think that's why she still stays with them... just so she can support her daughter.,1

domesticviolence,I really want to do something about it but idk what i can do.,1
domesticviolence,He's been horrible to his family since forever.,0
domesticviolence,"I get a text from my brother that was essentially, ""fuck off and die, nobody wants you here anymore.""",0
domesticviolence,"Clearly I need to move out, but the only person I have in my life is my boyfriend, and although we see each other often, we've been long-distance for awhile and it would be a huge adjustment to move almost 100 miles away (although it would be far enough away from them.)",0
domesticviolence,"Although I love him a lot, I don't exactly want the reason that I move in because he's trying to save me.",1
domesticviolence,"I want to move in because I want to start a new life with him, not to run away from the old if that makes sense.",0
domesticviolence,"So, I guess my question is, what do I do?",0
domesticviolence,I’m having a difficult time coping with how my abusive husband is perceived by family and friends.,1
domesticviolence,"He raged at me, then was perfectly calm and collected as we met family for dinner less than five minutes later.",0

domesticviolence,She stays with him.,0
domesticviolence,"Rinse and repeat, except it gets worse over time.",0
domesticviolence,"How can I break the cycle, or help her break the cycle?",0
domesticviolence,If you intervene he will stoop down to the lowest level cursing his sons out with the worst imaginable.,1
domesticviolence,"First the obvious question, is this domestic abuse?",0
domesticviolence,Domestic violence?,0
domesticviolence,Am I imagining this or blowing it out of proportion?,1

domesticviolence,"Turns out I get really numb as the only way to not get dragged into this emotional swamp, but is a hell for its own.",1
domesticviolence,Hating every single contact here.,0
domesticviolence,"But I told him that I’m not over it and his response was kinda like “ I feel so guilty, it makes my life hard, I wish you could just forgive me.” So now I feel pressured to forgive him and it’s frustrating because he didn’t give a damn about my feelings when I was 9 and crying my eyes out because I just saw my dad push mom and hit her.",1
domesticviolence,"In fact, I remember him telling me to shut up.",0
domesticviolence,He didn’t give a damn about my brother when he pushed him against a wall to yell at him when he was only in middle school.,0
domesticviolence,And I can’t help but feel like that fueled my brothers heroin addiction that almost killed him and still could cause he recently relapsed.,1
domesticviolence,I’m just so angry and I don’t want to be.,1
domesticviolence,She wont call the cops because her counselor confirmed they would take away her kids (her mother took all but one from her now).,0

domesticviolence,There are also things he doesn't like.,0
domesticviolence,He doesn't like when my mom go out to go gamble with his money.,0

domesticviolence,I'm scared to start the eviction process but I NEED to protect myself and my son.,1
domesticviolence,"Hell, im even scared to  ask this asshole to take the trash out.",1
domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
domesticviolence,I feel like an empty shell of a person with no strength to get out of this mess.,1
domesticviolence,This is mostly a rant but does anyone have any advice or words of encouragement?,0
domesticviolence,"The worst situations were forcing me to make a statement I knew was untrue (in order to allow me to get ready for work); becoming sexually rough and chasing me into another room to force himself on me, and rages where I’ve felt threatened.",1
domesticviolence,These things have ruined my trust and love for him over time.,0
domesticviolence,The controls and double standards that are in place are extensive.,0
domesticviolence,So why do I still feel conflicted about leaving?,1
domesticviolence,I guess I need an extra push.,1
domesticviolence,"I live in a high end building and I feel if I were to talk to the people who work in the office they wouldn’t take my name off the lease, that they wouldn’t care.",0
domesticviolence,"I have told a couples therapist and my individual therapist the things he has done in the past, and what he says to me and his actions.",0
domesticviolence,I believe they would vouch for me.,0
domesticviolence,"I also think if I were to say to the office people that I would like to leave before a real scene is made (cops being called, screaming, damage, etc) that they will be more inclined to take my name off lease.",0
domesticviolence,Thoughts?,0
domesticviolence,And I hated him too.,0
domesticviolence,I had dreams of him stabbing me in the chest.,0
domesticviolence,"Eventually I went to my mum, essentially I wanted out, him or me, like a stroppy teenager, and I made her tell me what was going on.",0

domesticviolence,He keeps saying im crazy not respecting his space where i keep asking for things to be amicable over and over.,1
domesticviolence,he tells me its my fault that everytime hes done anything to me its because i started it.,1
domesticviolence,I honestly dont know if its true.,1
domesticviolence,Because i kept trying to tell him leave me alone.,1
domesticviolence,She thinks instead I should ask if I can read him how it has impacted me since this has happened.,0
domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
domesticviolence,It's coming up so quickly and I'm feeling a twinge of anxiety as it gets closer.,1
domesticviolence,I keep telling myself I did everything I possibly could and that I should do what feels right to me even if it means I may feel like I'm going backwards at times.,1
domesticviolence,I also have to make a decision on if I want a permanent restraining order or a non violent contact order.,1
domesticviolence,I decided to park behind it to see what their business was.,0
domesticviolence,They called 911 on me.,0
domesticviolence,"I saw the copper stoppers coming and decided to pull in to my driveway, unload my kids and go inside while they dealt with the strange people.",0
domesticviolence,"Well, the were there to deal with me!",0
domesticviolence,And one was walking up to question me while the other followed my children into my house!,0
domesticviolence,"The real irony is that had my dad told the truth about the car, he would be home right now plotting his next scheme, but instead he lied and got caught because of his arrogance.",0
domesticviolence,"The problem we face now, is that there is always the chance my dad might sign the documents and they let him out (he'll probably weasel money out of his youngest brother/my uncle to pay the bail), and then we have to contend with the possibility my dad has something else planned to get us, which he probably does because that's his gig and his only goal in life since his big revelation after the pace maker got put in.",0
domesticviolence,"My dad cannot talk to Bart or Dandy because they are witnesses, and he can't have any communication with my mom either.",0
domesticviolence,"Myself and my brothers are contemplating getting a restraining order of some kind, but given how my dad operates, I'm not sure that will actually protect us from any harm.",1
domesticviolence,"I have an appointment with doctor Doorstall this thursday, probably won't get anywhere but I'm sure he is aware of my dad's situation by now, or will be soon.",0
domesticviolence,It was all so quick and I try and recall now what happened and my brain jumbles up the details but he finally realized what he was doing to me and stopped.,0
domesticviolence,I am a small girl with a very thin build at 5'8 and 125 to 130  pounds maximum and he is a big guy at 6'5 and and 265 pounds and I had no chance of getting him to stop.,0
domesticviolence,He started immediately after hysterically crying because I started to hysterically cry and started to feel like I couldn't breath.,0
domesticviolence,He spent most of the night afterhysterically crying telling me he can't live with himself after this and how he would never put his hands on a woman but something in him just snapped but I don't know how to forgive him or let it go.,1
domesticviolence,I'm still so shocked by what happened I have managed to stop crying and calm down but I don't know how to move on from here.,1
domesticviolence,I don't know what to do.,1
domesticviolence,"The police are no help as I'm usually tossed in the squad car and questioned like a fucking criminal because ""why would she lie?"".",1
domesticviolence,I can't keep the 2400 a month in child support up because I can't get a job (I usually make 3000 a month net) and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be homeless in a few days.,1
domesticviolence,All I want is to help my daughter and make sure she's safe and I've run out of ideas.,1
domesticviolence,Anything you kind folks could think of would be greatly appreciated.,0
domesticviolence,He said he'd take me to my mothers house if I just smoked a cigarette with him.,0
domesticviolence,"I did, but he refused to take me still.",0
domesticviolence,"I continued fighting his hold and he kept saying my name in a gentle voice and telling me to calm down, saying that he loved me and didn't know why I was freaking out, and kept saying, ""you know you're not going to win.",1
domesticviolence,"Go ahead, tire yourself out.",0
domesticviolence,"You know you're not going anywhere.""",0
domesticviolence,I’ve been in an abusive relationship for 3 years now.,0

domesticviolence,"The first time I noticed abuse was when he wanted to repeatedly have sex till I was sore, and would get angry if I refused.",0
domesticviolence,It was subtle at first but it scared me.,0
domesticviolence,"As time went on I would here everyday how I was too skinny, I need to gain some weight.. it got to the point to where I would ask questions about why I wasn’t good enough and was depressed ... he would throw a speaker in a room along with me and put stuff in front of the door to where I couldn’t get out.",1
domesticviolence,I got connected with the DV shelter in town to connect to my Crime Victim funds so I don't have to worry about therapy co-pays and I'm filled to the brim with anxiety about class tomorrow.,0
domesticviolence,I'm so tired of this.,1

domesticviolence,I hate that he saw that side of me.,1
domesticviolence,I don't want to look weak in front of him.,1

domesticviolence,"I'm not saying I didn't retaliate, but I only went to far as to push her away, never hitting her intentionally but more as an act of defense.",1
domesticviolence,He came home from who knows where and he walks in.,0
domesticviolence,I asked him where he had been because i was starting to get worried.,1
domesticviolence,"He was mad, i could see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice.",0
domesticviolence,Next thing i knew he was behind me with his arm around my neck squeezing.,1
domesticviolence,He continued as he threw me on the couch and wrapped his legs around my stomach.,1
domesticviolence,I have no worth or identity or breathe.,0
domesticviolence,He has blamed me for everything.,0
domesticviolence,I guess I am getting an abortion.,0
domesticviolence,"I was upset his friend brought him somewhere that he ran into a girl he loves, and even though it was just a second it really hurt me.",1

domesticviolence,He hasn't paid any child support.,0
domesticviolence,He isn't fulfilling the courts orders that would get him a chance to petition for supervised visitation.,1
domesticviolence,It feels like he's completely just disappeared from being a father but I still feel like he's going to come back.,1
domesticviolence,Even writing about it makes it hard to breathe.,0
domesticviolence,Is it silly?,0
domesticviolence,"He ended up grabbing me by the neck with both hands and slamming my head against the wall in the hallway, he threw me the ground I hit the radiator and then he threw a bucket at me that had a toy and DOG SHIT in it (i genuinely don't think he knew there was dog shit in it, he just threw whatever was there...and our dog must have shit in it.)",1
domesticviolence,I didn't pass out this time.,0

domesticviolence,He immediately started screaming at my friends to “get the fuck out” and aggressively pushing them out of the back door.,1
domesticviolence,He then grabbed me by my arm and shoved me out the door yelling “take her fucking ass with you.” My friends sat with me for a minute and asked if I wanted to leave with them.,1
domesticviolence,Nobody should ever have to put up with that and have to live in fear of someone who can fly off the handle like that.,1
domesticviolence,I wish so badly I knew who she was so that I could tell her in quiet that if she ever needs a place to escape that my door is always open.,0

domesticviolence,"I spent most nights waiting for him to pass out, which he never did, and running through our small mini-winnie as he chased me with a knife... My dog would come out from under the table (she was a rescue who had been abused) and would trip him up, letting me escape, and he'd hold her hostage-- letting me spend most of the night in the cold, out in the boondocks where it was common for truckers to come through and cougars to attack farm animals and pets.",0
