Meanwhile, the friend in the backseat, who we're moving, explains, ""You have to understand, I was just trying to get your attention.""

173,anxiety,I'm uncertain about what to convey to her.,1
174,anxiety,"I'm one of the few remaining friends who still go out to eat or drink with her, but I no longer want to continue. I believe I'm inadvertently supporting her unhealthy habits, and it's weighing heavily on my conscience.",1
