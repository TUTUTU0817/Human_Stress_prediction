Despite trying various government aids and charities, as a 35-year-old man, I truly have nowhere else to turn.",1,,

I truly feel like there are no good men out there.,1,,
"It was a constant rollercoaster; one moment we were happy, and he was more affectionate than in years.",1,,
I can't bear to see myself as someone who endured abuse.,1,,
 but I cant stand having to see myself as someone who was abused,1,,
I'm giving up.,1,,
Apologies for the chaotic nature of this post.,1,,
Laughing and showing affection to your latest victim.,1,,

Then, as my other friend, who is driving, nearly collides with another car, I suspect it's because he was under the influence of marijuana. Meanwhile, the friend in the backseat, who we're moving, explains, ""You have to understand, I was just trying to get your attention.""

"I understand that I should communicate my uncertainties to her, considering she has also experienced doubts in the past.",1,,
"She refuses assistance, and I'm feeling helpless about it, fearing it might strain our relationship.",1,,

"I haven't brought up my discomfort with the high percentage of female staff at this restaurant to him yet, but I have made it clear that I would prefer he didn't take the job.",1,,
I'm uncertain about what to convey to her.,1,,
"I'm one of the few remaining friends who still go out to eat or drink with her, but I no longer want to continue. I believe I'm inadvertently supporting her unhealthy habits, and it's weighing heavily on my conscience.",1,,
This has caused me to seriously reconsider my current location and whether I should remain here.,1,,
I'm not even aware that I feel lonely.,1,,
What do you suggest I do?,1,,
I'm feeling really bewildered!,1,,
He expressed that he harbored profound emotions for me.,1,,
