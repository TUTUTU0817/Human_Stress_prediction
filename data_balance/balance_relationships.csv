It made him worse, and he created an alternative character to threaten her, saying how he's going to find her, kill her and talk to me about their relationship. Being afraid, my wife added it, pretended to be friends, only to repeat this cycle several times over the next few years. Yes, they stayed in one way or another ""friends"" for years after this case.

I said ok. I live in 500 square feet a studio but I have a sofa in addition to my bed.

Thank you all for giving me the prospect that no, I wasn't unreasonable and it wasn't that he decided who lives in his house (which I never disagreed with) but that he was spoiled to offer him, plan, go back on it, and then wanting to act like that never happened. And for the people who suggested that I don't have a ""market value"" for him, my divorce was because my ex cheated.",0,,
relationships,,,"In addition, we use his car, which will eventually lead to the usual wear and tear and expenses. We also allocate all shared costs such as gas, food, rent and bills, but we both have the same salary and similar assets. Do any couple living together pool and split their travel expenses as well, or do you just fear it to a difference in individual expenses and each pay your own way? tl;dr: My boyfriend's journey is twice as expensive as mine and it doesn't seem really fair. Do we have to divide?",0,,
relationships,,,"We set our wedding date last August for July 15th. We specifically chose this date after looking at the average temperatures for this date for the last 5 years. We determined that the peaks were about 7 degrees cooler than the following weekends in July, so we went with the 15th. You don't know that, but my FLIL booked their family holiday for July.",0,,
relationships,,,"One night after going to a club, we go back to our friends and we huddle next to each other. She shakes her fingers in her hand and later in the night turns around and kisses me. We kiss each other all night. We couldn't do anything more because our friends slept in the same room. We only talked about that night a few weeks later when we went to a bar together.",0,,
relationships,,,"Since then, I've met some ""bad""--I mean some guys who lied to me, like this guy who was trying to convince me that he loves me and only wants me and I found out that he's been dating a girl since 2014 and they're waiting for a baby. So yes, after these few ""errors"", I started to have trust issues.",0,,
relationships,,,"The conversation started to warm up, nothing I said was enough, that we bought something, that I would cook with her, that we could go a day earlier and cook at my grandmother's, nothing. She pushed me back until I lost her and finished the argument that she shouldn't go with me this year. That she should stay with her family, that I didn't want her to go with my family so she doesn't have to worry anymore.",0,,
relationships,,,"(If so, how can I correct this?) * Is it a lack of clear communication? (By one or both) * Should I try to get back in touch with them? Thank you if you did so far.",0,,
relationships,,,"This led me to find excuses for not hanging out with him, which, yes, I feel bad. Thanks to my interactions with him, I had the idea that Jack is interested in me, in a way more than friends. I don't want to assume that this is a fact — it's certainly possible that he's just trying to make a new friend. With a lot of little clues that he's interested in me, however, the biggest clue is probably when I'm talking about my boyfriend. I have a boyfriend about a year old, and when I mention it, Jack seems very obviously uncomfortable.",0,,
relationships,,,"Good Goals - She has completed high school and already wants to go back to school. I like girls who want to get a good education or pursue entrepreneurship. Don't ask me much - Given my financial situation, she didn't ask me to do something that was out of my budget.",0,,
relationships,,,"I will not share my credit details. Although difficult, I will end my friendship with her. Maybe think about it if she apologizes but is not sure at the moment. I will cherish the ties with more on my other friends who have been super nice to let me know what is happening at home. It is really frustrating not to be able to face Jenna physically but as others have mentioned, I hope that others who initially believed that she will realize the truth.",0,,
relationships,,,"So now: we had been communicating for a while on our ex shit and stress, and about 3 weeks ago I was on an appointment and realized that I would rather have just spent the night with her instead of the date. A few days later, while taking some drinks and stress I kissed her. She kissed me back. We stopped before making love and ended up meeting a few days later where we both agreed to take things slowly, in the light of our most recent breaks.",0,,
relationships,,,"And we end up spending an indefinitely long time together that never seems to end. I really wish I could hang out with her, like cooking dinner, or going to a bar, or watching a movie, for example, and then both go back to our individual homes and do our own thing. But, that seems impossible. I guess I'm really if it's necessary to be constantly, physically, with a N/A for a healthy relatioship to flourish? Am I unreasonable/inconsidered in my desire to be alone?",0,,
relationships,,,"I was at home for the winter break, and I didn't see him at all during that time. My problem revolves around me feeling insanely guilty when I go out with him, when he buys me things, etc. It's like, I hear my mother's voice in my head and she yells at me for making bad choices, telling me that I shouldn't waste my time with a loser like him, that I'm a low life, etc. To clarify, I'm a good-two-shoes.",0,,
relationships,,,"Be prepared to contribute (reasonably). B - Calmly, with a neutral to negative vocabulary and intonation express dissatisfaction with certain behaviors, actions or results of the action and politely ask not to repeat the same behavior/action/doing so that the particular result does not repeat. Make sure that the message was audible and understood and if necessary still calmly repeat Be prepared to discuss calmly reasonable in case of decline. C - Harsh, sudden, strong expression of dissatisfaction.",0,,
relationships,,,"It's heartbreaking to see him waking up at night to cry. I suggested a therapy but he's not in favor of it. I think his passing father also changed his reactions, which are out of whack now. I was sick last week and was not in town - he left some dishes to fester in the sink, and I discovered when I came back that there was fungus on it. (i.e.",0,,
relationships,,,"When I'm single, it's never a problem if someone I see sleeping with others, but as soon as I fall in love, I can become a kind of possessive. My partner is very well the opposite. All his relationships have been opened and he slept with almost all his friends. Maybe a few months ago he told me that he would really like me to sleep with other people. I was pretty greedy but became strange fear of having to think that he was sleeping with other people.",0,,
relationships,,,"We kept in touch all the time (and he always seemed to want to see me desperately, even telling me things like ""I can't wait to see you as soon as I came back""). But when he came back, he didn't see me right away. And although I asked him a few times (like, two or three), we didn't see each other for almost two months. Finally, I literally said, ""Are we going to see each other again or is it just over?"" He immediately answered me asking me for an appointment for this week, in a good French restaurant near him.",0,,
relationships,,,"I could really use extra comments on this because I'm not exactly sure what a healthy and compatible relationship looks like at this point. When we try to get out and do things, we often don't have any fun because our personalities are fighting each other. Example of this, I wanted to go kayaking and was surprised that he said yes because he rarely wants to be outside.",0,,
relationships,,,"Joe and Janet live in the big city a few hours from the small town where they grew up. They came here for university and stayed. About half of Joe's circle of friends is Janet. Janet's circle of friends, including former buddies and his university peers. The other half are bar friends.",0,,
relationships,,,"And I also know that this is not what my grandmother would have wanted (she was very traditional, and having her granddaughters as a saddle holder would not be her style). Personally, I have nothing against changing traditions - I can't do it. Besides, I was not asked if I would be a saddle carrier, I just discovered by my sister that I would be one. My father was planning to tell me when I arrived for the visit.",0,,
relationships,,,"However, it seems to have few friends daughters and it is friendly with them, but not to this extension I would say. We have known each other for a month now and I wonder if I should wait for him to make a move / should I completely leave him since he is co-worker / or should I ask him out? I am interested in getting to know him and I have no problem asking him out occasionally, however, I do not want to rush things. On the other hand, I do not want him to become too old and have a lot of small discussions and not really get to know each other.",0,,
relationships,,,"My husband (29m) and I (26f) live across the country of our parents and have been there almost two years now. I don't really have a relationship with my parents-in-law (that is, they never ask me once to ask what to get my husband for his birthday and rarely talk to my husband, they don't ask me or seem to be interested when I'm raised) and that doesn't bother me because they're incredibly negative and angry people. My son has problems of anger and is going to have a fusion in public (he did it several times before me) and my millet is absorbed by myself among several other problems. I don't want to get into every story, and the man makes me stories, but I guess it's important to know that I've been warned of their general attitude and behavior of others and of all those who have met them that I'm friends or family with me agreed that their son is the source of their happiness and that they feed on negativity.",0,,
