ptsd,,,"I have a dog that I got during the abusive relationship that led to my PTSD, although I have never been able to prove that there were obvious signs that it was abused by my ex too. She has always been very sensitive to how people feel and act (when I have an episode with my celiac disease she's going to cling to my stomach and won't leave my side) could it be a starting point for me to train her to recognize when I have a major panic attack and just stay with me until he passes?",0,,
ptsd,,,"My family thought it was an invasion of the house so that people would recover their weapons and prepare for self-defense. After the authorities overturned the door, they announced themselves and threatened to kill everyone inside. My family dropped their weapons and went peacefully. After several hours of ransacking our house, the feds arrested my little brother on charges of the most serious kind.",0,,
ptsd,,,"I've been an autopilot, but I've never experienced anything like an out-of-body experience. When this intense part fades, I'm just stuck in my head for the rest of the day, exhausted. Has anyone experienced anything like that?",0,,
ptsd,,,There's a waiting list to call when they become available. I don't want to start training a sheltered adult dog to become a service dog. I think there's too much room for error if I'm not the one who socialized the dog from the start.,0,,
ptsd,,,So thank you. My day has improved. I am in medicine so I took my alprazolam and I went to a store to try to find a dress for a next wedding party. No luck.,0,,
ptsd,,,"Many of you who read this still serve in the army or first responder, corrections or medical care... the ability to get up and say, I have to take a little time to manage my PTSD. In fact, it's a guaranteed way to be in JPSU or office service until they can start you the door. You can't start EMDR or CBT without telling your employer, family and support network what you're about to pass. &nbsp;",0,,
ptsd,,,"We talked about Buddhism and karma and how everything is connected. It turns out that everything is connected. My grandmother was a slut to my mother, my mother was a slut to me, I had to act one way or another. The perpetrator, the victim, and the rescuer exchange positions. I was told that I show symptoms of BPD, ADHD, but I was not diagnosed clinically.",0,,
ptsd,,,"Writing is one of my methods, and I wrote this and I would really appreciate the comments or any idea about why I'm not able to hold back today. I write this, because I feel and try to avoid a complete panic attack. I'm stronger than my negative thoughts, and I have the power to control them. Writing actually looks less real, and it's not true. My dream continues to play in my head as a record and every time I get a preview of the album I avoid it.",0,,
ptsd,,,"Is it different from other occasions like people/objects that remind you of it (more/less extreme, etc.)? I hope my questions are not confused (like the last one!) It's not a sloppy poll, so don't hesitate to comment on anything besides what I ask you that you think you are important to this character I'm writing. And again, mods, if it's not appropriate, let me know and/or point me to a better sub!",0,,
ptsd,,,"I was violent and my mother was afraid for her life. It started at a very young age. The first time I remember her telling everyone that she was afraid I would kill her I had about 7. I had only raised my voice in protest because I was severely punished for 7 days for ""lying"".",0,,
ptsd,,,"A sustained intense noise like music doesn't bother me. Basically, I'm just scared very easily and have a visible response. It's pretty embarrassing in social and professional contexts to the point that people think I'm pretending but I really can't control my reaction. I've been diagnosed Bipolar and BPD but this particular symptom doesn't really fit either.",0,,
ptsd,,,"Well, not big but petty. Look, I live around the area of my attackers. If I ever meet them, I wish I could scream out, ""rapist! You know what you did!"" I wish there were witnesses and they could think about it.",0,,
ptsd,,,"Things can happen during the course of life that are quite normal, then something happens to change our perceptions and suddenly we can remember something that had previously appeared harmless to us, but with our new perspective found, we can feel guilty about it. And we can feel guilty about things that we haven't done, we can feel guilty about things that we haven't done, but we want to have, and of course we can feel guilty about nothing at all. We don't have to do anything or fail to do something to feel guilty.",0,,
ptsd,,,"I learned how to handle panic attacks at work - I have a process to deal with these events now, and they often work. But the reason I'm really ok is because I don't push at all to make friends, or date, or extend my life beyond work and my little world. I can't extend it.",0,,
ptsd,,,"After being a group counsellor for months without improvement, I decided to look for an individual therapist. I only had one year after the event itself. Now, finally, 5 months later, I was able to see a psychiatrist who officially diagnosed me with a generalised anxiety disorder, depression and PTSD. I decided to get a workbook and my therapist and I will start the long journey through my PTSD!",0,,
ptsd,,,"Two of my best friends in the last 10 years have escaped me. I received a diagnosis of PTSD a year and a half ago, and at the time they were very favorable. But in the last 6-9 months; in fact, almost never since the government-funded early retirement went on the table, they didn't have as much contact with me. Normally, we write by email, but it's been about 3 months since I received an email from them. Yesterday, I took the initiative and wrote them both CCs.",0,,
ptsd,,,"This could be defeated by the National Post's impression of a rebuttal, highly formulated and well studied (the antithesis of the illiterate vendetta Cosh written and Owens supported) explaining the science behind the dogs PTSD Service: science that has been peer reviewed and little studied since 2002.But unfortunately, since now the National Post refuses to take an oath to all journalists who talk about integrity and education.",0,,
ptsd,,,"The vehicle then hit a tree and entered the river. He was able to get out of the vehicle but the river rapids were too strong and he couldn't save his girlfriend and son. He then had to find a house or someone with a phone to call 911. Once the rescue arrived, they couldn't save his girlfriend and son because the water was too high and dangerous. And all the occupants died in this accident.",0,,
ptsd,,,"Attachment and a secure basis are the two things that a PTSD survivor does not have. Fixing which is the key to their recovery. It allows survivors to reconnect with the family and the world in general. &nbsp; Social level: Sachs-Ericsson & maters all the way in 2002, go figure, found that people with service dogs were less socially isolated and felt more comfortable when initiating social interactions with others, also increased a social desire of survivors (note also that Henry & Crowley 2011 found that a sense of self-esteem of survivors as well as of murmuring were exponentially increased by having a service dog).",0,,
ptsd,,,"But the second time I got off the bus, and turned around to walk on my street, I noticed him going up next to me and starting the same model. Black tinted windows, darkened license plate, but looked out of the state. Makes a police report the first time, just went straight to the police station the second time. I was talking to a victim's defender when two officers took an interest in the case, and started explaining harassing intimidation to me. They asked if I had abusive relationships.",0,,
